deputy conner was still there, standing in the living room looking at him.
he pulled out a small black boomerang and got closer to the two of them. we better get out of here, nancy said as the guards continued their fight with big petey and the rest of the team.
he knew the questions would keep coming and that he needed to find a better reason for his presence.
