usually i was more aware of my surroundings, but today i was tired and didnt care if i rammed into a tree. i kicked a rock into the grass. the sun was starting to set, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds.
i couldnt let the creature reach my house.
they dont know the half of it.
i didnt open his reply because i knew what it would say. i already knew that it was strangely quiet. maybe i could stay home and sleep one night.
i spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth. i felt a searing pain as the thrasher raked my left leg.
my backpack was slung over my shoulder, filled with my writing books and sketchpads. i kept my eyes on the shadowed road, watching my every step.
instead i lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it, until i could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes. thrashers hate everything and sometimes i wonder how they tolerate each other. i aimed for the head again and released the arrow.
my shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound. yes, blue, my blood is blue. it turned back around and threw its self at me.
and if i was lucky, it would be an easy take down. i closed my eyes and began my mental countdown.
i pulled back the string, and then stopped. i couldnt take out one of these like, this unless i set it on fire.
