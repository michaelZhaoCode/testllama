usually i was more aware of my surroundings, but today i was tired and didnt care if i rammed into a tree. i kicked a rock into the grass. the sun was starting to set, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds.
i couldnt let the creature reach my house.
they dont know the half of it.
i didnt open his reply because i knew what it would say. i already knew that it was strangely quiet. maybe i could stay home and sleep one night.
it slipped down the sky, allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain. the remaining light cast shadows over everything, creating the illusion that there was double of everything.
thrashers were probably one of the most feral and nasty monsters ive ever encountered.
it was hunched over, occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws.
they sometimes travel alone or hunt in packs. theyre awful in packs, extremely hard to take out without their knowledge of your presence. i placed an arrow in my bow, and aimed for the head.
i spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth. i felt a searing pain as the thrasher raked my left leg.
4 power surged through me as i was freed from my human self. shivers ran down my spine. 3 i felt cold, like being dipped in ice water.
see anything? do you want me to meet you? i glanced at the nearby woods.
my backpack was slung over my shoulder, filled with my writing books and sketchpads. i kept my eyes on the shadowed road, watching my every step.
it whirled around, facing me. a low growl sounded in its throat and it charged.
isbn: 1492913731 isbn-13: 978-1492913733 for my family, who encouraged me to never stop fighting for my dreams chapter 1 summer vacations supposed to be fun, right? i wish i had a better answer to that question. starlings, new york is not the place youd expect much to happen.
dark saliva dripped out of its mouth. the beady black eyes made it no less scary.
instead i lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it, until i could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes. thrashers hate everything and sometimes i wonder how they tolerate each other. i aimed for the head again and released the arrow.

my shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound. yes, blue, my blood is blue. it turned back around and threw its self at me.
and if i was lucky, it would be an easy take down. i closed my eyes and began my mental countdown.
i pulled back the string, and then stopped. i couldnt take out one of these like, this unless i set it on fire.
i ducked as it slashed my side and i winced.
i flipped open the pad and wrote: walking home.
the breeze picked up even harder. 2 i was hollow and could probably see my own body if i opened my eyes. but i could never get the courage to do that.
the only reason why no one knows this is because jason, emily, seth and i have kept it that way. i walked along the empty road alone, occasionally waving to passing kids on bikes.
i started to climb the hill when i froze. out of my left eye i saw the outline of a creature.
its a small quiet town, the kind where everyone knows your name.
its a place where your parents wouldnt even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends. only because everyone felt so safe, so comfy.
but i do. i know it all and starlings is not the place where you want to be after dark.
i pushed him off and grabbed my fallen bow, the familiar feeling of the wood boosting my confidence. i turned back around and started back where i left off, but then a body slammed into me.
it whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur.
the world prepared to go into its hours of unreal silence that made it seem magical, and it really was.
my body felt normal except it was different. i opened my eyes and looked over to where i just had been or still was.
it was heading through the woods in the direction of my house. i swore under my breath and took off for the woods. my feet crunched on the fallen branches and leaves.
but emily wasnt here. i could take it out with a few arrows but its best to kill thrashers before they realize youre there.
my phone buzzed and i awoke from my trance.
the wind picked up around me, as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere.
my ears heard nothing and i didnt see any movement but my hands shook slightly as i typed, nothing, im fine.
i just had enough time to see the thrasher, before the fur and dirt filled my vision.
5 my body started to feel hot, like i was being hugged by the sun.
my human body slightly glowed as it sat in meditation under the tree. it didnt move. i could see the monster clearly now that i had stepped into its world.
this time i was prepared.
or maybe i could finish a painting tonight and watch mom do origami. i turned the corner, and my house came into view.
i didnt need to tell the others, it was just one.
i shoved it back in my pocket and continued walking. the sun was almost gone and shadows were starting to appear behind everything.
i pulled out my hunting knife out just as he landed on me. he yelped and went limp.
i looked at my own shadow, that danced behind me. the phone buzzed again as seth sent me a reply.
i knew exactly what it is. a thrasher! a shiver ran down my spine.
i could see the creature ahead of me.
i thumbed the keypad and opened the message seth had sent me. it read: whatcha doing?
i didnt have much time. i placed my bag on the ground and crossed my legs. i started to grab my phone but stopped.
