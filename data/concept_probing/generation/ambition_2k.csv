"He could not know how long he waited, clutching his pencil, desperate to answer the elusive question.",0
"Bart cursed himself for underestimating the complexity of the research project and wondered if it needed more qualitative data or statistical analysis. Either way he was stumped, but he preferred not to leave it unresolved.",0
"Do not worry, I'm not disappointed, but your advisor should definitely be informed about this.",0
"Rafe felt his stomach tense into an ever-tightening knot; he had no way to know what his advisor was thinking. She must be displeased, probably tired, and definitely expecting better results. The thought of her disappointment, and the knowledge that he was the cause of it, made him wince.",0
One of the students gasped and Blanche trembled as she stood beside the tall stack of academic papers.,0
It was so sudden; both players pulled away from the tackle and looked at each other with wide eyes.,0

"She couldn't call the captain for directions because she didn't know his number. She had to do something, go somewhere; she couldn't stay lost in the stadium.",0

He tried to think what investors salivated over large returns before committing funds. He hoped the slow movement of his hand toward the presentation deck was imperceptible.,0

"In the case of his constituents, his supporters had refused and now the representative was left powerless and perpetually frustrated.",0
Montrose got up from the podium and moved around the debating stage.,0
"He takes a deep breath and responds somberly, yes, Senator. Stanton calmly states, if this bill is a farce, impeachment proceedings, which usually take months, will be expedited in weeks.",0
She'd begged the political strategist Nix to foresee a way around this scandal. Nix had told her to simply own her narrative and everything would work out.,0

"He straightened from the easel, stiffened, but he didn't try to prolong the critique.",0
"Danven spoke in hushed tones to the band, keeping his elaborate conductors' gestures to a minimum.",0
"Before I could send them to perform in front of strangers, could I trust them to harmonize with those they called friends? Although I would never intentionally throw Oraden or Tahir into an unprepared gig, on this I agreed with Alexander. We had to know if they were ready, Demetrius said.",0
How can you be sure the other musicians you brought here will remain committed?,0

"It may be a good idea to bring a flashlight or something as well, Natasha whispers seriously.",0
"By 1996, Alex was in his community, and he had gladly given up the idea of moving to a big city and instead went for stability in family and local engagements. He managed to acquire a fulfilling role: community coordinator for one of the top non-profits in the area.",0
"So he was basically volunteering his whole life right? Yeah, pretty much and he was good at it, so by the time he was eight he had organized a few events and was getting support from the community just because it was good for the programs.",0
"We must act quickly, he tried to keep his voice low and calm. Even as he was making his plea, he could hear a commotion in the distance, closer, and coming from the neighborhood.",0
"He turns to run, but I bring him back into the center of the community hall and sit him down gently. It calms him down and he stops resisting.",0
"He nodded, offended that his ability to support his community was in question.",0

"He's none too worried about the experiments he neglected, my colleague and his thesis, and half the lab’s issues must come from his endless distractions.",0
The researcher knew much too much about the implications for comfort.,0
"The media was saying that we were conducting unethical experiments in those labs, and creating dangerous substances with everyday chemicals.",0
"He looks my way and I give him the slightest, thankful nod. Gilbert doesn’t say anything else as we wait a few more minutes for Walter to return with a couple of new specimens beside him.",0
"As we analyzed, I immediately picked up on something peculiar. Dorian's data was inconsistent - too inconsistent to be real. He was obviously falsifying it, but his team could not challenge their lead researcher.",0
You must release my samples and provide us with new equipment. This must be done in exactly the way I shall instruct you if you are ever to see the results again.,0
"A scientist has to leave his assumptions behind, like outdated theories you don’t need in your research. What they really mean when they ask you to think critically is to leave behind biases.",0
Thomas grabbed his lab coat off the hook before his brother reached for his data sheets.,0
"I remember all too well what it was like for me in those chaotic days after our research was compromised. I stop that avenue of thought and pull the flashlight from my bag, turning it on as we reach the end of the tunnel.",0
"After the lab accident the day before, I was afraid to go back. For the first time in my life, I actually considered sitting out the experiment and staying home.",0
"We will adhere to your protocols and your infrastructure, Fanchon said.",0

"You had no problem with me holding onto your laptop last night. Now get a grip on my suggestions, she says, and update your code.",0
"Then the system simply crashed, screens staring blankly, and processed data no more.",0
"Maybe Reece had some misguided fantasy that Ridley was going to become a programmer like her, now that she was interested in tech.",0
"I moved through the archives, slowly working my way from file to file. They were not a company that had maintained data well, as a whole.",0
"But Cassie knew to ignore the risks, and she also understood that, for Adam's sake, she had to appear confident they were doing the right thing by rebooting the old system.",0
He sighed in relief when I assured him I would be available for the meeting.,0
"We will chat later, but now I am exhausted and need to log off for the night.",0
"Everything he had done to dethrone the influencer who was going to ruin their reputation had worked as much in their favor as his own, but none of them knew what had transpired.",0
We made a review of the content archives; the main account was the principal page for the brand and therefore populated accordingly.,0
"Then the silence was broken as thumbs began typing and notifications started popping. A few of the moderators had their fingers hovering over the delete button, as if trying to hold themselves back. They wanted to ban him, but they were fighting the urge.",0
"A couple of the admins had the same trouble that the users had, just as at least one of the users had no problem navigating the new update.",0
"But she found the rest of the internet didn’t share her interest in supporting talented underrepresented creators. Sponsorships had dried up and the campaign was close to failing. So, in desperation she had recently resorted to also promoting the platform as a haven for established influencers looking for fresh ideas.",0
"He inspected the profiles for a moment before grunting in satisfaction. He turned and disappeared around a stack of marketing reports that split the dashboard in half, and reappeared moments later with a strategy he passed to Michael.",0
"He knew what she was doing, knew that she couldn't bear to read the rest of what he had posted because she wasn't yet sure what her response would be. Or maybe she already knew but simply didn't want to comment right now.",0
"He had decided to start building a meme collage in the comments section out of GIFs, making a little adventure out of staying online.",0
"Simon had expected Jace to debate him on this, to argue, not to just agree without a fight.",0
No one spoke during the meeting and hardly any notes were taken. A tension filled the room and the knowledge that this was their final review grieved all three.,0
"He allowed her time for short breaks each day to maintain her productivity, but she wasn't allowed any extended, exciting projects. Just some basic tasks—mostly organizing and filing small documents while seated at her desk.",0
"The second clerk roused up, abashed; the two employees muttered excuses, which Junichiro evidently cut short; he motioned them out of the office, and stepping in, made to oversee the work in their place, his face hard and watchful.",0
Leo leaned over the desk and took her coffee cup in his hand.,0
And he was at the moment speaking to someone on his work phone.,0
"The next morning at sunrise, everybody snuck in early and went to the rooftop office.",0
"Stokes added, sir, during the negotiation, we lost senior analyst Rodriguez and your two consultants. The two data scientists are all right with a few setbacks, but we accomplished the project, sir. My team, the developers, and all the accountants really tackled those issues.",0
She found the rhythm of the project and decided she just needed to immerse herself.,0
It made Ryan happy to know the manager approved of Natalie.,0
"A CEO must have full or partial support of the board according to company policy. Deep in Aten’s mind, he wishes there was a different leadership structure. The CEO knows the company’s success rests on his shoulders, and his reputation is on the line.",0
"As such, you should have alerted the dean to the discrepancy.",0
"Once he got a sip or two of the French press coffee in him, though, it was difficult to get him to stop lecturing.",0
I held the specimen in place and he calibrated the microscope.,0
"He coughed with a sore throat and cringed with the pain of it. Finally, he relaxed the tension out of his face and spoke again.",0
"He turned around to face Whisper, who was standing back with her arms crossed, observing.",0
"I knew enough about professors to know that if I did tell them what had happened, I would not be believed. Professors rarely seemed to believe me when I told the truth anyway.",0
"You can take it to him whenever it's convenient for you, he said as he painfully laid face down on the dorm bed. He trusted Randi but he wanted to verify that the assignments were graded first.",0
"Taking them out of the class roster was something we'd discussed the first morning we realized they all seriously skipped class, but neither of us turned out to be that bold.",0
"Yes, he understood that it was in everyone's best interest for Blackbourne to believe there was no chance that he and Sabelle would collaborate on the paper. But the academic rivalry still made him eager to prove to everyone else that Sabelle was, and would always be, his co-author.",0
"He laughed at her wit, then his eyes turned serious while he slid the textbook down the table, to her side.",0
"If he has done anything unusual on the field, please remember that he only has the purest intentions and I apologize for him.",0
"But the coach refused to speak, though the players gathered around and begged him to say who had given him the strategy. At first, they promised him all sorts of rewards, and later they threatened to bench him.",0
"He may in fact be penalized, Mateo said, but we will establish that through the proper sports regulations.",0
"He plants one end of the pole in the ground and vaults himself, feetfirst, at my defending position. He screams in effort as the soles of his shoes connect with my padding, and I'm sent flying backwards.",0
"Genghis knew he should not see it, but he watched anyway until the match ended.",0
She looked up at me for a second and opened her mouth. A blob of black liquid burst out and spilled down over her chin.,0
"The captain turned, giving Bethel a none-too-gentle tug. Stumbling a little, he accompanied Lodestok back to the captain's bench. Lodestok strode over to a seat and threw himself into it as he usually did.",0
"He was looking at me the same way he had when he sat down next to me at my game, even though the section was all roped off and only the team members were supposed to sit there.",0
"He must see the confusion on my face, because he smiles and pats Bernie Kosar's shoulder.",0
"They locked and secured their locker room, they spoke only to their teammates and those they could trust, and, when the training sessions were canceled, they practiced at home in the evenings.",0
"I couldn't sign the deal just yet—not until I'd ensured the legal unit was out of Yohan's way, and my partner was on board.",0
Beth called the ever-ready Sanjeev and instructed him to be primed for another client call tonight.,0
"She read about strategies the mentor had already told her: that for years he and his partners meddled in the market, shaping trends, building firms, disrupting industries.",0
"He called or emailed daily how much he appreciated her. Whether they were busy with projects or not, it didn't stop him from making her feel valued, and she definitely tried to return the support.",0
"When she laughed softly, this time it didn't end with her wincing from stress.",0
"When she was younger, her mother had diligently taken her to coding boot camps and business workshops, and she never lost the analytical approach of a hacker. When she was nine, Zanas had begged and begged to attend the entrepreneurship program in the big city.",0
"No one made demands of the venture capitalists unless they had a foolproof pitch, so this one must be impressive indeed. She heard skepticism in his voice, a skepticism that was barely controlled. Please market trends, give him the insight he needs to save us, she thought.",0
Uncle Macon cleared his throat and adjusted the sleeve of his crisp white suit.,0
"Many people he'd networked with in the past months said he had a face identical to Ashton's, except for the stern expression that covered up a little less than half his face. Refusing to linger any longer, or bother to listen to the assistant, Ragnar walked proudly away.",0
"I start to turn my head back to the founders, but a man with long hair and a stocky build stumbles from a meeting room, waving his hand at me.",0
"I had a theory that because they were not so consciously aware of their own rhetoric, they could be persuasive and quick.",0
"I knew a few things nobody else did, that's all. I knew because I got the chance to talk it over with Senator Felton minutes before he was investigated.",0
"He would have played the influence card years earlier, but of course, he'd needed to wait until Teddy had climbed the political ladder far enough to steer the policy his way.",0
Bowie steeled himself for the possibility that he might have to take over the campaign at some point.,0
"It was just his fear of losing support that compelled him to do such, or so he told himself as they rallied off.",0
"For ten years I debated against four opponents, every day. I defeated those four opponents in arguments; to debate one opponent is a luxury, it becomes so easy.",0
"Bailey figured it out a few months ago, Eugene whispered, leaning in.",0
"Kiara wished she could think of some way to keep his endorsement around her, but his support vacated her and left her longing. With deft movements, he signed her bill and passed it.",0
"As she lay in her bed, staring up through the darkness at the bright flashing lights outside, she decided that tomorrow was the day she would finally go to the capitol.",0
"She walked straight to the conference room, and took the elevator down to the press briefing.",0
Roth laughed as he slipped the sketchbook back in his pocket.,0
He patted her shoulder and then came to sit with the other artists.,0
"I know, Tom, which is why it is you who must choose. It is given to you to make the choice of continuing or quitting the project.",0
"You and Broderic must take the painting with you and display it in the gallery, far from here.",0
I was there to get Ambrose back to that creative high of his. My mind accepted that readily and I once again had the strength to continue.,0
"He leaned in again, his breath brushing against the canvas I was working on.",0
"If you should feel queasy or light-headed, step outside for a breath of fresh air and this will clear your mind.",0
"As soon as she realized what she was doing, she snapped her eyes back up to his face and saw the faintest smirk on his lips. Harlow cleared her throat, the most awkward blush creeping onto her cheeks, and started adjusting things on her own easel.",0
"He decided to challenge my critique, so I had to defend myself, but debates do not always end well.",0
"The artist stared at her for a moment, eyes wide, his face already pale.",0
"If he made it through this tour, his schedule was going to be a little slower for a while.",0
He and his bandmates had come over here to cause a scene.,0
"The concert had no end in sight, and it would do me some good to perform, as the manager had suggested, for a live audience.",0
The fans know this and will leave us be until tomorrow.,0
"I know you can handle multiple instruments better than anyone else, girlfriend.",0
"Jill was fast asleep, which I took as a small blessing. I wouldn't have to face her questioning look or figure out how to handle the awkward silence.",0
"For a moment she wondered if her fans were still calling for her. When her nerves subsided, she rejoined the band in the practice room.",0
"He stood with his feet apart and his guitar ready at his side. The little Kahshian faked to his right, and Nab spun and strummed a power chord.",0
"Members also had to agree to share stage time without jealousy. Performers would address the conductor as Maestro, not to signify a master-slave relationship, but as a sign of respect.",0
"She lets out her breath and lies against the piano bench, staring up at the low wooden ceiling.",0
The words rumbled around her sleep-deprived and stressed mind. She kept waiting for the words to make some sort of sense to her. She shook her head as the meeting surrounding was just too confusing to really be happening.,0
"Yeah, that might have been a little bit of a stretch, but I was going with it. I took a trembling breath, trying to calm my nerves before speaking.",0
This is good because it made sure that Ray wouldn't be any competition for the leadership position.,0
The power to influence and organize people and events was like a passion to him.,0
They reached the end of the street and made a right where the community center sat nestled in the corner.,0
"We sipped coffee together, and her expression became more lively as the caffeine kicked in.",0
"Ashamed of my harsh comments, I close my eyes, wanting to run away. Maybe Kimberly's right, and I feel sick at the thought.",0
"They were milling about, worried and unsure, and, like important folks everywhere, when they were worried and unsure they got frustrated.",0
"I think that there are others like us who are tired of Guinevere’s domineering ways and constant use of scare tactics, but without someone else to follow, they are rallying to her because they feel they have no other options.",0
"Much to his surprise, Tarren eventually stopped fidgeting, and appeared to remain calm. Shaken by the close call, Laverick stood in place for a short duration as a bead of sweat ran down his face.",0
"When she looked back, Devontay was rummaging in the lab, emerging with the beaker in his hands before slamming the cabinet shut.",0
"Yes, research can frustrate, confuse, and confound; but it can also enlighten, elucidate, and clarify. It can open one’s eyes to possibilities, or it can blind them completely.",0
"He said goodbye to Amy, then stepped up to the apparatus. The man in the white lab coat gave him an automatic nod.",0
"It made sense to him, but he never confirmed it. He hated verifying hypotheses to make sure he was right.",0
"I spotted an opportunity and did one of those quick transitions from one experiment to another, no hesitation, and then sped up and switched back over to the original hypothesis.",0
"She steps into the dark, silent lab, ready to share her findings. Dot is so lost in her thoughts that she doesn't even look up when Lucy walks in. She simply stares down at the data she clearly isn't even analyzing.",0
He remembered one of the reasons why he and Malou had never completed that final experiment.,0
Riyan moved closer to see what discovery may be inside.,0
"Just as the second assistant reached the end of the bench, Matthew heaved the flask over the partition.",0
"He'd gone on and on about how we should just let her rest, but I knew the truth. He was afraid that if she knew I was leaving the project, she'd try to stop us.",0
He handed her USB drive back and as he exited the room she heard him whisper back thanking her for putting the software back in its folder.,0
"Reining in his own desires to upgrade had been the most difficult challenge of his life, but he'd done it.",0
Mary rejoins them and resumes her position next to David at the central workstation.,0
"She'd lost her temper once before—once, when her first manager chose the wrong day to push her too hard. She still remembered the feeling of hurling the laptop at his desk, and the stickiness of the coffee spill on her hands and face.",0
Some developers injudiciously agreed with Orrick's proposal while others vehemently refuted it.,0
It was the term that some of my IT colleagues had used for him. I didn't know what to say because I hadn't done enough to deserve the recognition.,0
"Some of them sit down at their desks, eating their snacks, while others walk and chat by us, brainstorming.",0
He scribbled it onto a sticky note one of those that were on his desk and flicked it over to me when he was done. It hit me in the chest and fell spiraling down to the floor.,0
"Still, I liked the thought of making the competitor sweat a little. And I certainly wasn't in a hurry to get there, anyway. I finished my coffee, then pushed away from the desk.",0
"Later, I got the promotion, and he got laid off.",0
"I will have you start updating the profile graphics first, he said, pointing her to the back.",0
"If you want the top comment, you'll have to come through me, she declared.",0
"I fought to get to my laptop as he plowed through the notifications in my direction. I was sure that his profile picture was actually glowing red, all traces of the friend I knew gone.",0
But my headache started throbbing and he made me log off.,0
"A short time later, Thomas pushed through the media feed with a meme that he had obviously repurposed from Alanna’s post.",0
"Without a word of protest, she slumped on top of the keyboard and was asleep within seconds. Leaving the chat open, I shut off all the apps and returned to the couch.",0
Henry was in command when they were moderating the prime hashtag campaign.,0
"They wanted to get as close to the trending topic as possible using the tag, to minimize post engagement distances.",0
"The old man with the white mustache was mumbling, shaking his head at his grandson, who looked rather unhappy now as well.",0
"Bauman stuffed the phone into his pocket and returned to the group chat. Rick moved to the next post, and Bauman sat, pushing away the thin strands of tousled hair that had fallen across his brow.",0
"The office environment was fairly quiet and Stephanie selected a beginner's task for them. They returned to the break room, and she pulled out some team-building activities, and through sheer force of bubbly personality managed to get Nora and Maryann engaged in them.",0
"I probably met half the department, with the exception of anyone my age. And in a small company like ours, when most of the employees come into a small break room like Finch's kitchen, one can safely expect the gossip to be rampant.",0
"He moved to the door, threw back the dead bolts, and didn't look at Jazz directly at all.",0
"I lay in bed staring at my laptop that contained Isaac's email, which I had never replied to. I thought about replying a hundred times, but all I had were a bunch of lame excuses I knew anyone would see right through.",0
"She used to say that she and her sister Lucy were inseparable because nobody else in her department chatted unless they had to, but she and Lucy had to be huddled up like close friends all the time.",0
I collaborated closely with him and learned much of his work habits.,0
"I let him help me arrange the middle of the presentation, though I didn't need the help.",0
"He tried to make it a joke, but his eyes gave him away.",0
"Thinking back, I truly regretted the way I acted during the meeting and if I could, I would go back in time and change my past behavior.",0
"He shook her hand, but she stepped out of his office.",0
"If he was to complete the thesis, he had to buy time, at least until his advisor arrived.",0
"I buried my face in the scent of the library books, and hid against the bookshelf.",0
"Fats had still not responded, and Andrew had not seen him all morning, because they shared none of their lectures. He had not seen Fats for the previous two weekends either, because he had been studying at the science lab.",0
"Brody requested that she kept to the simple theories because of his lack of knowledge in the confusing academic fields. It was simply explained that Kate had created a research grant in both of their names, and named it the Rose Grant, in honor of Brody's charitable mother.",0
It was hard to convince people that phenomena happened outside of what they knew.,0
My fist hit Raz's textbook and then went through it.,0
"He shook his head, expression so clearly filled with remorse it was as if he was a different man from the one who had graded her paper harshly.",0
Charles began to forget the horrible results he had just witnessed and started to smile as well for Alice’s achievements. The darkness of her past failures was gone and she would always have the will to pursue now. Charles felt like he had made his deal with academic success.,0
"His left hand moved lightly up the curve of her argument, and in the morning light she saw a fine lacework of lines around his eyes when he smiled at her.",0
He was pale and did not appear to be awake during the lecture.,0
"The wide-eyed coach hurried to help the injured player off the field—and then another player, following after.",0
"I patted the bench and she sat down beside me, all the while watching the referee warily. I reassured her, and that seemed to be enough because she relaxed.",0
"Vasquez will go back and tell him that we, specifically Tony Russo, didn't ask him a single strategy question.",0
"He went away for seven weeks for training, and by her calculations, he should have already been back.",0
"I had to fight to remain steady, and clutched desperately at Devyn's shoulder for support.",0
The team captain scribbled the game plan on a notepad and told his teammates to check the field from which the ball had emerged to see if there actually was any sign of a foul play.,0
"A defender turned to face him, lifting his guard to cover his face and thrusting blindly. Manea brushed aside the tackle and crashed down with an overhand pass, breaking through the defense and scoring.",0
"Before that he had managed, though half injured, to create three amazing goals.",0
Aunt Tabby was holding our team hats and she looked really irritated.,0
Jane looked up at Macklin with that determination in her eyes that he remembered and was inspired by.,0
I started living and breathing for the sound of his business advice.,0
"We would take our chances with potential investors and test the pitch in several meetings along the way. As a last resort, if none of this worked, we would go back to the drawing board the way we came. At this point, one strategy seemed just as risky as the next.",0
He looked toward the market trends where his competitors still held their positions.,0
We go together to raise capital against the giants of the industry.,0
I didn't hear the whole strategy until much later that evening.,0
"He quickly sat down again and asked his next question, barely giving the team time to argue or disagree.",0
"In all the years I'd worked for him, I'd never seen him this happy, and I wasn't entirely sure whether to be amused or concerned.",0
"I prodded my brain with a sharp reminder until it figured out my next business move. My brain pointed out that I knew the current industry leader, and that the guy owed me some fairly big favors.",0
"Charles tried to keep his composure and to not let panic take him, after he took his first call with the client he ended it.",0
"Morlin smiled as he spoke, and Castellan felt confidence spread into his chest as if the motivational speech was directed only to him.",0
Allan lowered the discussion topic into the debate to introduce it. It took him some effort to pull the conversation back up once it was in full swing.,0
"What are you doing in this committee, you are obviously not a member? My name is Bendedikte Loevaas, she said evenly and with a touch of defiance.",0
"If he is still a viable candidate, we'll rescue him from the vile smear campaign and return him to the race.",0
Gus raised his hand signaling Matthew that he had the floor in the conversation and sat back in his chair to listen.,0
"Barachiel ousted the first opponent in a debate, and I rebutted another—well, nearly, anyway. I set him up for Twila's counterpoint, so I was an accomplice for sure.",0
The speaker paused for a moment and pulled back his notes.,0
"The aide turned back to Ki, looping an arm under her shoulder and helping her to stand.",0
"He examined her policy proposal, and then dropped it into the discussion.",0
"In the meantime, the reformers of the legislative bill between Jupiter Street and Buendia Avenue had started drafting their respective points in 1974-1975.",0
She didn't really realize the enormity of the political situation at hand.,0
"When I got to the bottom of the staircase, there was a line of people waiting to pass by the gallery attendant and the turnstile that he controlled.",0
"They had been talking, quite seriously, about moving to Reading, where Ruth's sister and brother-in-law lived, to open an art studio.",0
"She took him inside the gallery so that she could teach him to appreciate abstract painting, one of her favorites.",0
"He plunged forward, fighting now out of fear of what would happen if he stopped creating.",0
"Amira was only a few yards away, but her vision blurred and her pulse raced as she approached her art piece.",0
"She gripped the brush, determined to leave one last stroke for Storm to see when she left.",0
"Kelly tugged her long brown hair out of its braid and shook it out. I haven't seen or heard from her in, wow, must be over two years now since our last exhibit.",0
"As he started up the stairs, he looked back and saw Hamish reaching for the door to the storage room and Eloise opening the studio door.",0
"The curators looked at one another and then, as one, took a step towards the exit.",0
"I haven't received official confirmation yet, but I'm pretty sure I'm commissioned until graduation. Get your portfolio packed, and be ready when I get there.",0
"She leaned forward, still holding the sheet music closed at both ends to keep it from falling.",0
"Unfortunately, creating more tracks and remixing again was not an answer to the largest creative block that had ever been created in his career.",0
"I had never been nervous around a fellow musician before, but this one was different and I actually felt like a tongue-tied fool in her presence. The night we had our first jam session, she was late, and I'd been terrified that she'd stood me up.",0
"She'd gotten herself through music school with it, crammed it in a crappy apartment with three bandmates.",0
"He didn’t hit a wrong note, but the surprising chord got the audience’s full attention. Releasing his own tension, Cage jumped back and stayed low to the stage while holding himself up on all fours. Rhody quickly found his beat and played murderously at Cage, but didn’t move to compete again.",0
When I came into the studio there were no problems to be worked out. The rhythm was good and there was no reason to ask questions.,0
Most of all she'd been angry at herself for not being able to come up with a melody that would help.,0
I drove along until I found the most level pitch I could find and took a deep breath and charged uphill. Miraculously the wheels found firm footing and I made it all the way up to the concert stage.,0
"The second part of the review concerned a song that had been found trending near the top charts. A piece of something else had been found in the song, in the lyrics from what Nero could understand. It was only a written review with no annotations attached.",0
He tugs his fingers through his hair and yanks on the roots as his head falls forward.,0
"Someone must have trained him, because in a too-fast movement he grabbed her wrists, twisting her to the ground. She slammed into the courtyard so hard the air was knocked from her lungs, her head spun, and she lost her grip on the flyer.",0
"He heard muted laughter and a young female voice hushing the neighbors, and his curiosity got the best of him.",0
"The intrepid volunteer streaked past the food stall, and she adjusted her course again, putting the meandering crowd between her and the first aid station.",0
The man hit the ground at a roll and was on his feet not far from them. He looked at James and then back at the rapidly approaching community organizers.,0
He waved half his volunteers toward the back of the community center to block off the only other exit.,0
He approached her slowly and placed his hands on her shoulders.,0
"She really wants me in a fancy outfit and to have a fancy community event, I guess. The event was still two months away, but when both sides of your family are influential community leaders, you kind of have to plan things out a little early.",0
She lifted her coat over her head and let it fall to the park bench.,0
I was glad for the subject change but not so happy about where it went.,0
"Kody raised her hands and formed a shadowy box between them. Because of his historical knowledge, he knew she was opening a window to show him events. But where he used his for the future, she was showing him the past community decisions.",0
Those words brought tears to his eyes as they reminded him of so many others who'd belittled his theories because they envied his discoveries. How many peers and colleagues had come to him for advice and then criticized him the moment after he'd shared his insights?,0
I shook off Dale's arm and took a step toward Evan.,0
"Without taking his eyes off the Petri dish, he extended an arm and the specimen hung from his fingertips.",0
"I dozed off one night in 1983, listening to a science podcast. When I fell asleep, I was listening to a piece on chemical reactions; when I woke up, they were talking about climate change.",0
"He pushed to his feet and gave my lab coat a playful tug. That's why I'm going to go upstairs and apologize again, even though Aislin and I aren’t really working on the same project.",0
"She paused as if waiting for him to object to her hypotheses. Patrick recalled Rousseaus’ and Filippi's warnings, but his instincts told him that he would get nowhere with the professor by stonewalling her.",0
"The assistant didn’t reply, and Keirran finally bent down, putting my arm around his shoulders.",0
"You may be deliberately disabling your monitoring device which makes you a liability to this research facility, Morgan said in a chilling tone.",0
Jolon felt like he was on the verge of blacking out and it took a huge effort to get one foot in front of the other without falling.,0
"He marked her report with his notes, and let her annotate his.",0
"This was the principle of those portrayed on the company’s founding wall and it was the same principle Eli was charged to uphold as CTO. He let out a satisfied sigh, which was stopped short when he turned to see two outsiders entering the office.",0
"After a few minutes, he gave up and went to his quarters. He would have to consider long and hard over the events of this day, and he thought he could do it better here than at his study.",0
Check on my assistant intern and be sure he's in bed and not downtown partying. He eased the door open to the intern’s room far enough to see that he was sleeping soundly and hopefully stone cold sober.,0
"I control my frustration as I grab a computer wipe, clean my screen, and ask, how do you expect to meet the deadline if you don't work?",0
"He staggered back, hit the server rack behind him and rebounded. She sidestepped, added momentum with a straight arm across his shoulder blades, and he sprawled facedown across the table.",0
My users love it and it's our most popular app.,0
"Upon seeing me she rushed to us without hesitation, with the most worried look on her face.",0
Tom couldn't debug the code and he wasn't certain that he really wanted to.,0
His left arm was in a sling and I could see the outline of bandages beneath his shirt. A faint grin tugged at my lips when I observed the stylus clamped firmly at the corner of his mouth. He looked pale but otherwise seemed to be his normal self.,0
"Why did he have to watch her configure the system, anyway?",0
It forced him to slam on brakes and put the car into a sloppy ground loop to avoid hitting the parked influencer's vehicle. Brooks was standing over a comment thread and moderating the heated exchange.,0
"With a grin, Sarssen crossed his legs and stretched out with a yawn, scrolling through his feed.",0
He chuckled with pride when I described how I’d landed the first viral post.,0
"At any other time he would have asked them to stop so that they could take a break from the screen. When he turned to the side, he was surprised to discover that Rowan had been watching him.",0
"She frowned as she raked her gaze over that profile that was made for likes up to those clear, breathtaking comments. No one would ever guess Xypher was anything other than human, yet she knew better.",0
"Rae shot back a sarcastic comment, but then tried a more conciliatory reply.",0
"As I took this social media journey, and twisted my strategy into unrecognizable distortions, Mery-et suffered the most even as she gave me her full support.",0
"She wanted to put herself in harm's way, wanted to reply to the burning post, and he’d forbidden it as well.",0
I had no reason to think that it was a waste of time engaging with the content.,0
"Stepping back, I pulled my hood up, and the black cloth helped camouflage me. My profile was already liberally anonymized, so I went with it, covering every traceable detail. Chance did the same, and then we slid away into the digital dark.",0
"Her eyes were calm as she looked back at him. She wanted to hug him, but she couldn’t say that so she instead took a more logical explanation. I need something to rely on and you are all I've got.",0
"The two sit around and drink coffee, saying little to each other. Laptos breaks the silence by asking, when will you present the report? If all goes well, I will finish it in two months, Daygun replies.",0
It sometimes annoyed Catalina that everything about Philip's outer appearance conveyed perfection. She wondered what he would do if she walked over to him and messed up his perfectly organized desk.,0
"His lungs tightened, holding his next breath while he waited to see how she would respond in the meeting.",0
"Yes, they had chatted frequently, but rarely about the important projects.",0
The first troubling reminder of her initial anxiety came about a week later when they were going to the conference.,0
He ended up taking on excessive projects and overworking for a thrill. He had to keep raising the stakes in the end because the thrill wore off and he crashed into burnout.,0
"I walked over to the presentation slides with heavy, reluctant feet.",0
"I wanted a travel allowance and I required two rooms. I reckoned that was the minimum we’d need on a thirty-six-hour business trip—one for myself, and one for Mairi and the baby.",0
"I press down harder, finally feeling his stress start to ease in response to my reassurance.",0
"So they bought a run-down university building, redesigned the lecture halls, decided on a name and opened for classes.",0
Dan fell on the study floor and let her climb over him as she criticized his thesis and questioned his sources. They went to the research library and Dan carried Alexandra through most of it.,0
Clarissa flipped her brunette wavy hair over her right shoulder and dropped her over-loaded gray backpack onto the lab counter.,0
"Mike lowered his research notes and crowded into the study booth, Karen rushing up behind him. The couple stared down at the fake data as Elvi did, then peered at each other, then back to the data, then to their professor.",0
"My head spun with the enormity of it all: a single study, distant by a century, was still affecting thousands, perhaps millions of scholars today.",0
"For the last three years they consulted with Professor Herod. The wise and noble professor valued sound advice from learned colleagues. Now that Herod is retired, his students are vying for research funding.",0
We've all certainly been on edge these last few days before finals.,0
"Marissa progresses quickly through the campus, doing a quick survey of the research posters displayed.",0
"I wanted to teleconference with Manco, who knows everything about ancient civilizations, but Alura warned me not to contact anyone from my past. I couldn’t take the chance of putting Manco or his family in danger under any circumstances.",0
"I expected to see Daemon, but they had called on him earlier. I hated not knowing what was going on with his dissertation.",0
He shoved the throttle forward with a gleam in his eye that said he was barely one half-step from scoring a goal.,0
"When the coach returned home, he finally got what he considered to be very good news about the team's progress.",0
"Then she ran to the locker room, seized the telephone and called the sports center, but the line was engaged.",0
"It dawned on me around lunchtime that I hadn’t seen or heard from Al since the game on Saturday night, and I felt an immense guilt; which I managed to suppress with thoughts of how if anything had happened to him I would have heard.",0
"He kept up the passing drills, repeatedly coming dangerously close to my position. After a while, my legs tingled, kind of like when we had practiced together before, but not as overwhelming. When I finally reopened my eyes, Hayden had this serious look on his face.",0
"It was the young athlete that had brought her here. She had a vague recollection of Coach Randwulf calling him Leofric. As she watched, he grasped the towel that Eda had left floating in the ice bucket, wrung it out, and placed it against Finan’s feverish face.",0
"This meant he would have to leave a perfectly good training regimen behind, which he considered terribly wasteful. He even went to the trouble of reinforcing it to handle the heavy repetitions.",0
"She relied on the gymnast's muscle memory to take her higher until she was on the beam that stretched toward the middle of the arena. She climbed out toward the apparatus, and just as she reached the peak, the beam began to wobble.",0
"In one powerful punch, I knocked Alastair on his back. “You could’ve been a little quicker on the defense,” I said in a quiet voice as his teammates surrounded him and helped him to his feet. Their bewildered looks made me want to challenge all of them.",0
"Though that wasn't the same thing as telling me he’d call the referee, I made myself smile at him as we went back inside. He resumed his seat as Roy returned to the sideline.",0
"But you and I still have some business plans to finalize here. And though she would never admit it, Tina thought James made a fair argument for putting away the trial runs for good.",0
"Take anything you need, our resources are at your disposal.",0
My smirk vanishes as Neal continues to glare at me.,0
"By 8:30am, his email inbox had been cleared completely and he focused on his tasks of the day.",0
"Obviously, no one had ever gotten the best of him at negotiating, and he didn't know what to make of me—a true threat or a novel amusement.",0
"During the meeting, I sat in the executives' row, but it took a while for me to feel like a real CEO.",0
"He crossed to a trash can, throwing the prototype samples away. From that distance, he turned and tossed something to her.",0
"The investor looked surprised, but evidently decided not to go into it.",0
"No one said a word, but he had a feeling that the assertive entrepreneur was about to get a serious dressing down.",0
We trade some ideas with the international partners every six months.,0
"She stared out the window for a long time, remembering her campaign manager, whom she hadn't seen since the election.",0
"I know you are the one who leaked the confidential documents. That I am, Cada Varl replied flatly, showing no regret or pride in his voice.",0
"The truth was that Aidan hadn’t been afraid of the press conference, or the media questions flying at them. But he was afraid of whatever influence Itzy was having on his political career, without her even being aware of it.",0
"Katricia straightened and moved aside as he approached, giving him space, and he felt relief slide through him.",0
"Like the knowledge of how to navigate a debate, he somehow understood that a person usually had to work hard at networking to have such a strong political base.",0
"Rob Sardan is going to be a legend, but the road to leadership is paved with temptation and deceit.",0
It was only when I got the policy documents back to the office that I looked at the piece of paper Spartan had given me.,0
Victor answered DJ's hushed question with a shake of the head.,0
I need her by my side when the decision time comes.,0
"Karen stood upright, kept moving forward, and got so close to Lea, that only the most compact criticisms could be launched.",0
"She took a step down the gallery corridor, and I nodded. She continued, walking before my easel, her pudgy hands by her sides. Keeping the canvas at brush's length, I glanced over my shoulder.",0
"She felt she could look at the painting for hours on end, and when she had her new place, she would probably do just that.",0
The three of them are under the impression that this art collective will not last as it is for long.,0
"She tried to recall her dreams, assuming they must have caused the thumping heartbeat and clammy sweat that she could feel freezing on her forehead in the chilly studio.",0
"Brit walked over to me, wanting to know what to sketch next.",0
"""You had one sip of wine and started crying,"" Denaos replied. ""Perhaps you should preserve your dignity now and flee before you find another sip of this stuff and add involuntary dancing to the problem."" Dreadaeleon somehow managed to find a healthy medium between fury and astonishment at the insult.",0
"A moment later, all three removed their virtual reality headsets and turned to look at Steffor.",0
"His stomach still churned, but he felt the strong bond that he and Cody had formed during their duet. It gave Tom the strength to keep his nervousness down. He wouldn’t want any other person standing next to him during a performance.",0
"Before I came here, I was very biased toward modern art, but they are not like our old art teachers taught us.",0
"It was a dicey question but his voice sounded innocent, like he was just curious about the technique.",0
He pulled his guitar from its case and contacted the sound engineer.,0
"Since his bandmate failed to make an appearance, Korsten walked toward the stage, hating the hollow sound of his lone footsteps upon the polished floor.",0
Misaki and Katie were lucky to find a table up close near the stage and quickly took a seat. The two girls ordered beers and sat back to kill time as they waited for the concert to start.,0
"You hear it all the time in the news, someone having a musical breakthrough and going on a rampage with a new album.",0
"Jodi smiled and helped her daughter tune her guitar and arrange her sheet music. If you consult records kept by the recording studio, that is what you'll find. Your dad beyond those records is a man with no identity or record, he doesn’t exist.",0
"I can take my time and make you listen, or I can do it quickly and be through with this song once and for all.",0
"We wake up with the sun, and before eating or showering Katarina has me run vocal drills in the backyard: singing scales, doing breathing exercises, and practicing pitch control.",0
"Why sit in an office when I can tour the world and play music, Jill yelled. We are approaching showtime, so put your gear on, the stage manager yelled.",0
"He was scratching at his swollen throat and still laughing. Their host was standing over him, and the first thing she saw was that his hair—that baby-fine, shoulder-length white hair—was now almost entirely black. The lines around his eyes and mouth had been erased.",0
"The two of them ran from backstage to backstage, slid here and there, and jumped from speaker to speaker. Only one guy from the production team could keep up with them.",0
She caught a glimpse of her reflection in the community center window.,0
"Trent turned to the commotion, his lips parting as he took a deep, resolute breath. Funny, I'd have thought he'd look scared, not determined, and I stifled a surge of what might be a feeling of community solidarity.",0
"When my feet hit the hallway floor, I glanced down and frowned with distaste. I still wore the volunteer badge; the flimsy thing hadn't magically disappeared.",0
All she could do was stare at Nykyrian as a paramedic moved forward to feel for a pulse.,0
"They have earned a reputation for disrupting communities, not serving as organizers for them. Gentlemen, let me assure you, this group working hand in hand with community leaders can bring no good to anyone.",0
"Amma rubbed my shoulders as she spoke, and I felt a shiver go down my spine.",0
"Thank you, Ella smiled broadly and her heart seemed to lighten. She felt like hugging the woman, but curtsied deep instead.",0
I heave a great sigh as if it'll be my last breath on earth.,0
I'm going to go ascertain how Tunstell is getting on with the neighborhood watch. Then I think we might need to notify the community board.,0
"Regardless of their origins, people thrived in the barren lands of Amoria Minor until they crossed the Siren Seas in search of a better life for themselves, and subsequently, a worse life for those who currently resided there.",0
The general belief is that he concentrated so much on the experiment that it gave him some kind of mental overload.,0
"He jumped off the lab bench and sat before the experiment setup, and the others joined him.",0
"All along, ever since the fateful night that I made the decision to revise the hypothesis, I’d been doing what I swore I’d never do.",0
"Anytime you wanted to introduce someone to your research, you gave them the initial findings for free.",0
Unni lifted the heavy microscope out of its casing again and adjusted it as carefully as she could.,0
"I yelled to Edmund, who had been sulking in the control room.",0
"Pointing to two of his lab assistants, John said, ""Pick him up and sit him down."" Judge looked squarely into the dazed scientist's eyes and said, ""There will be no negotiation, and you have one more opportunity to answer my question.""",0
"We’ve had enough of the head researcher who’s hell-bent on shelving young scholars. There's another three facing his review board the day after tomorrow. We just can’t condone it or be party to it, so we want to get away.",0
"I backed away from him and then turned to run. Before I could take five steps, I was in his arms and we were racing across the laboratory like a flash of lightning. “No!” I sobbed as the lights from the experiment became a blur. ",0
"It had a damnable side effect of causing a person to open their notebook and reveal their deepest research secrets, especially if those secrets had to do with breakthrough discoveries or innovative ideas.",0
"She was debugging and coding and doing whatever fool thing she does, said Mrs. Hamilton, her steel grey eyes scanning the gathering crowd of engineers and developers.",0
"I just need to grab something from upstairs then we can go, she announced. She walked unsteadily and gripped the railing for support as she climbed the stairs. ""This isn’t good,"" Colin whispered, when she was out of sight.",0
We stood there as the laser pointer bounced between both of the screens. I knew he was expecting me to choose which presentation to favor. I also knew he would make that decision in the end.,0
"I had been down here before during my late-night coding sessions, had gotten to know some of the programmers who inhabited this strange server room. As I made my way toward the underground network, I feared that there would be more glitches—many more.",0
"Jill had assured me back at the office that she could operate the drone, although she had never flown anything in her life and never had a lesson. She told me she had read the manual for the drone and was confident that together we could figure the thing out.",0
She unrolled the blueprint and laid it out on the desk.,0
Their lack of strong emotional ties facilitated their acclimation to the startup life. It also created a divide between them and Eve that was undeniable.,0
"He handed them his authorization and waited as they carefully read it. ""This is the technician they said might be able to improve it,"" one manager said.",0
They have arranged for your workstation there and you would learn in detail about the problem from this girl and her father and thereafter I’ll talk with you once again before you commence the project.,0
His son grinned and motioned to the mad genius riding flat out into Jokull's engineers with her code ready.,0
"He knew that the other was trying to keep them from looking at their notifications, to keep the fear from growing as they waited for the announcement.",0
"For a while we just stay that way, me on my chair and Mavis feeding me ideas for content.",0
"He liked to use memes and emojis to do the talking for him. Tara also looked about inquisitively at the posts, noting their positive tone.",0
"At length she recollected the whole hideous scene in the comments section, and finally recalled the strange troll account in whose replies she had sunk into oblivion. D'arnot wondered what fate lay in store for her now. She could neither see nor hear any signs of activity about her profile.",0
"He made his way to a sidebar that I had yet to see, due to the masses of posts standing in the way.",0
"He found spam carefully stored in a digital folder in the hidden messages section. The password was changed, as the possibility of account duplication was high.",0
"He knew that he wasn't pronouncing the hashtags correctly, but thought, what the hell, I think he understood me. The follower, an influencer in his mid-thirties, smiled, checked out Rick’s profile before commenting.",0
Kathleen pushed away from the feed and stepped back into the dimness of the chat room where Tommy lay in the presence of his friends.,0
You’re to carry my profile away with courage and honor while my sister attempts to stop you by using any means necessary.,0
"I turn away from them; I can't let myself be distracted. I have to focus on my grim objective, and it's now or never; I have to eliminate the account that took Preacher from me.",0
"Two security guards stood watch, and he knew they wouldn't allow them to simply walk in and look around. He hoped Bart knew what he was doing; the office looked pretty daunting.",0
She closed the distance between them to shake his hand.,0
The reports were signed by the manager with apparently genuine signatures but the manager had been retired long before the reports were supposedly finalized.,0
I picked up my briefcase and moved out into the conference room.,0
"He moved closer but stopped, obviously not willing to step between them during the heated discussion.",0
"Finding their errors were insignificant, she let out a sigh of relief.",0
"""Yeah, I thought so,"" he said, but he was much more interested to see that Gaia was unscrewing the cap of a bottle of water and pouring out a measure.",0
"When she first started this habit of lunchtime charity, she began with fifty dollars a week and she would search out employees in need.",0
Juan said they fled back to headquarters when he was investigated.,0
"She manipulated Poppy into giving his presentation, forcing the issue. She even gave the audience an excuse for why he hasn't done it yet. She didn't introduce herself, but everyone assumed my great-grandparents know all about her.",0
"He kept asking himself that, as well as wondering what he had done wrong in his research. The sound of the office door opening caught his attention and he glanced at it, expecting it to be his advisor. He was actually relieved when it was the department head instead.",0
"As with most of the academic disagreements that resolved in heated debates, this one had to do with influence and funding.",0
"He thought his feet would slip, but it felt like he was walking on a solid path to tenure.",0
"What Peter did not know, he could not be made to defend, nor need he contrive to play his part in the paper. It would have to be done tonight, before Aspen returned.",0
"No sooner did he step out of the lecture hall than the phone started ringing behind him. Jay leaned back against the office door and counted the rings. Hiram didn't give up easily, he had to give him that.",0
"With John Foster gone, there was no dean in the department I could turn to for help, and I didn't have time to apply for any outside assistance.",0
The tenured professors lord it over the adjuncts and love every second of it. The new hires desperately want to be taken seriously and are constantly trying to prove themselves.,0
"Despite his racing heart he was calm and careful as he began climbing down the academic ladder, clinging to his research. He hung on tightly, blocking the sounds of dismissive comments from his mind.",0
Lady Maccon moved them on from the pleasantries with a direct reminder of the publication deadlines.,0
It remained with him as his own personal exciting secret. He thought of it as the letter from a reviewer unknown. He sometimes whispered the strange name of the reviewer to himself when no one could hear.,0
"He shrugged, raising his open hands to his shoulders, and she had to laugh. She did it softly so as not to disrupt the team meeting, but yes, she did have to laugh. A line from some old game came to her: ""I play how I feel.""",0
"Whatever the case, I loved this coach now and I didn't want to go. Much as I wanted to return to my hometown team, I didn't want to go.",0
He pounded the locker so hard with his fists that she felt the concussion like multiple blasts of a bomb. She covered her ears against his howls that were equal parts frustrated and furious.,0
It was only as she put her gear into the locker that she remembered the dead batteries in her headphones.,0
A man brought me here to set me up and make those officials think I cheated.,0
"No matter how much I might have told him to leave if he could not respect my playing style and strategy, I didn't actually want him to go.",0
"I knew I should leave that play alone, but I just couldn't seem to bring myself to do so.",0
"He also felt relief that he didn’t have to feel that way, and silently congratulated himself on having the good sense to have avoided falling for Susan, the team's manager, from the beginning.",0
"The stress of the day, particularly the rigorous training, has worn me out.",0
"I realized it was Robin a second later, at the same time that she turned to look downfield. A look of surprise crossed her face during the brief second before her focused mask returned. She made to come after the ball, but his shouts rang out before she could.",0
"She is the finest businesswoman I've ever seen or met, but as I am now, I won't be good for her nor will I use her for my personal gain or lie.",0
Though be advised that he will attempt to come up with outlandish and wild excuses to explain his business decisions.,0
She staggered to her feet and watched as the four much larger security guards had to struggle to hold on to Wren. They surrounded him so well that Marguerite couldn't even see him anymore as they formed a barrier to protect the team.,0
When all of his proposals came to no avail he finally insisted that she be his business partner.,0
"He strode across the office floor, and Dunk was forced to hurry after him.",0
Then Julio arrived at the boardroom with a big smile on his face.,0
"After they returned to the company headquarters, Allahandra had personally given them each a wax-sealed letter. The wax was red but the crest was clearly Allahandra's.",0
"As Alex hobbled into the office with her dad and Aunt Meredith by her side, the whispers began among some of the staff who watched Alex come in. This must be the day that Alex would be pulled from the startup, they quietly suggested among themselves.",0
"He was about to discard the idea when he stopped, his hand paused over the trash and lowered his arm, and decided to hold onto it. He had the small prototype and now he had some fallback if the main plan didn't work out.",0
"Rachael connected an LCD projector to her laptop and made a statement that the information was classified as confidential, then began with some presentation slides.",0
"She not only knew the policies, but she knew them better than he did.",0
"The senator entreated the guard pleasantly, enquiring simply of the mayor's whereabouts. All had gone to the meeting, for they’d been discussing it for nearly two weeks, was all the guard was inclined to offer.",0
It is time to move toward the capital where the negotiation will take place.,0
"Trust me, you have no idea how bad you're going to feel if you don't address this issue.",0
It was his voting record that made me know I’d chosen the correct candidate off the list.,0
"You are a far better public servant than I ever hope to be and I would not only be honored to be your partner in office, but eternally overjoyed. I support you, with all that I am, with all that I ever hope to be.",0
"As she took the chair across from him, she thought of her parents, sitting together at their table in that upscale house of theirs.",0
"Hiro smacked her proposal away, bringing his bill closer to him while glaring up at Anna.",0
"He was disillusioned, but he was not born that way, Chetsune continued. This politician is fully capable, but his integrity has been severely altered. You believe he was made disillusioned in order to attack the reforms?",0
"He turned to leave, and saw a closed chamber sealed by a wooden bolt. He went to it, stood before it for a moment, then drew one of the big policy documents he carried low on his hips.",0
"Ryan noted that the entire exhibit had barely drawn the attention of the local art community. Most continued their browsing, eyes focused and shoulders relaxed, perhaps pretending that if they just ignored the avant-garde installation it would somehow become less intrusive.",0
He shifts onto his side and props himself up on an elbow to view the painting better.,0
"When I started teaching him to sketch down by the river, a crowd would gather and soon we had a full class of locals and art students alike.",0
"All we need now is your signature, the gallery owner told her. Again, there was no response as she tried to hear what was being discussed in the judging room. ""Don't clam up on us now,"" the owner said sternly.",0
"I closed my eyes and tried to remember what happened. After a few seconds, the memory of Susan being carried away by the inspiration for her mural came back to me and my breath caught in my throat.",0
I resisted a powerful impulse to run to her; that had availed me nothing a month earlier. An older artist perhaps twice her age followed her every brushstroke.,0
"He would undoubtedly destroy her canvas at the least provocation, and then regret his action for eternity. He had to protect Rina from Kalin, and protect Kalin from his own destructive tendencies—a difficult task requiring shrewd thinking.",0
"Even Jim, who had been morose and withdrawn all evening, was drawn into a discussion about modern art with Frank.",0
She rested her head on Oseth's shoulder and realized it was his time to contribute to the storytelling session.,0
You two can sleep on the studio couches out here while you think about where you will exhibit next.,0
"She didn't wait for the drummer to finish, but cut in with a few riffs of her own, challenging for the crowd's attention and suddenly understanding why they called this a battle of the bands.",0
"Since none of you let me do anything except sit and keep an eye on the soundboard and monitors, I learned about half of your playlists. Natana, your mom called for you eleven times today, from what I heard, and I learned your name after the third track.",0
He was so excited he was getting to see one of the concerts. He wished he was there to see it in person.,0
"No, he was definitely not an exceptional performer in any particular aspect.",0
"Marlin waved his baton, and suddenly the notes became melodies, all of which fluttered in a harmony to the floor.",0
"I am here with money, extravagant gigs and plenty to do, and fans to keep me busy, but I will tell you a secret. She turned toward me and whispered conspiratorially, ""I am not happy.""",0
"He pulled his hand back, then swung it forward with as much force as he could put behind it. The guitar pick found its mark and struck the perfect chord.",0
"She went to the computer and got out the playlist and searched for every possible song with the name ""Collins"" that was played in the area. She tried for over an hour to locate it, but was unable to.",0
"She remained stock-still and closed her eyes, letting the music wash over her. Moments passed and she opened her eyes again and breathed a sigh of relief.",0
He wondered if she was there and contemplated hiking off the stage to meet her backstage. He thought about the outfit he had on and changed his mind. He had put on an old pair of jeans that had hardly any knees left in them.,0
He had recognized early on the ability of the neighborhood organizer and realized the better initiatives the community leader had made had actually been suggested by the smaller man.,0
"Alex made her way back to the community center, where I caught up with her, just as she went into labor.",0
Even those who supported the losing proposals were suddenly swept up in the community’s exuberance.,0
I'll miss Fiachna dreadfully and I want him to know that.,0
"I start out by leaning on his shoulder, but I'm so wobbly he just scoops me up and carries me upstairs. He tucks me in and says good night but I catch his hand and hold him there.",0
"I start scanning the bulletin board, looking for the community event flyers I need. After several minutes, convinced someone has already taken them down, I move onto the next board, and that’s when I see him.",0
"When at last she was able to release her son, he and Riyan left and headed over to the community office.",0
"He stood in the doorway for several tense seconds and then grunted and walked off, leaving her to unpack. She forced herself to take deep breaths as she moved to the door and slammed the bolt home, remaining outwardly calm even as she seethed with quiet rage.",0
"After Terri had been taken into foster care, her father had had more kids.",0
"Bernard bent down and kissed her forehead, then rose, leaving.",0
It is said that students present today are learning to harness the power of their minds. They learn to utilize high-energy particle accelerators and develop groundbreaking insights.,0
"Lost in thought for several minutes, she had taken her eyes off her Petri dishes.",0
"They might even care about your research if you gave them a chance, but if you don't you can't blame them for the distance between the two of you... You have so much to look forward to, don't run from the challenge, analyze and embrace it.",0
"Whatever was in that lab was dangerous and best to avoid if possible. I wanted to save our resources for our final experiment with Katarina Fox, and not waste it on her preliminary studies.",0
"I shook my foot, closed my eyes, and tried to remember to breathe. How ever did you conduct these experiments all alone when you came to MIT?",0
He was humming a data sequence she had never heard before. It was the most extraordinarily beautiful pattern she had ever analyzed.,0
"Auron tried to be the better scientist, for he saw no merit in confronting Barvoch's flawed hypothesis.",0
I open the lab door for her as she comes near.,0
"It took him fourteen trials, but in the end he achieved significant results.",0
"My heart had jumped at the sight of his hazel eyes on me, which made me panic. I admired Gareth for his intellectual curiosity, but never had I thought past it. Was it possible for me to have developed professional respect for him?",0
"Luca, who, knowing all that you now know, chose to breach the firewall instead of complying and worse yet, he chose to try and lie about it.",0
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a sleek USB drive.,0
"Since everyone had been accounted for except the missing code, the bug charge brought against them was officially still in effect, the project manager had said, until Mariana's code was found alive and well.",0
He started waving his arms and shouting from across the data center at me as I stayed at my desk laughing.,0
"So I, an expert in debugging, slurred out various sounds similar to what Angel said the error could be, and I was accepted into their little troubleshooting circle.",0
"They had made him look incompetent in front of his own team and the Turkish client, already eager to latch upon any excuse to deny their proposal.",0
"So she decided her answer would reflect that, ""Neither do you,"" then she poked her tongue out at him during the virtual meeting.",0
"John had to know it was some kind of tech trick, but he started coding anyway. I wished Liv were here to see how brave he was to tackle the complex algorithm.",0
"When you feel like you're overheating from stress, you just let it vent. The trick is to learn to center yourself, and own that frustration in tech.",0
"The man gagged as Jerrod twisted the faulty wire and the gap widened. The system crashed to the ground, dead before it hit. Another technician, a tall, swarthy looking man, saw what happened and cried out a warning, but Jerrod’s task was done.",0
"I spent my life not having as many followers, not as much engagement, as those around me, but in that moment, it was brought home to me that I could be their influencer, but I would never be their equal.",0
"She whispered the last into my ear, so close her breath moved my hair, just like a secret DM.",0
"He waited for Adri to nod her head in answer, gave her an extravagant virtual bow, and strode gracefully and silently to the admin's dashboard. Opening a tab, he produced a new post draft, title, and tags then motioned for Adri to come.",0
"I couldn't help the love of my life, so I certainly can't help him navigate through hate comments.",0
"She instructed Tasha to like her post and share it as she had done. Once Tasha had complied, Ann took her daughter’s phone in her own, rubbed their screens together and allowed their mingled followers to spread the post further.",0
"I was grabbing some socks out of my drawer when Evan walked into my room, probably to borrow my charger again.",0
"He wiped the comments on the deleted account’s page, got up and returned to where James lay unconscious in his room. He checked James' notifications and was relieved that his account was still active.",0
"Edeline glanced at Ember, who seemed on the brink, already, of going viral herself. She had grown more than a thousand followers since the morning, and her profile was bursting out with all sorts of trends and content previously unimaginable in the perpetual newbie.",0
I was on my feet and scrolling through the feed two posts at a time toward Julian's profile.,0
"I had purposely not set notifications, and it was the light coming in through the pulled back curtains that caused my eyes to open and check my phone.",0
"Kat seemed to vibrate as she stuck out her hand for me to shake. I did, feeling the pressure of her grasp through the formality of my suit. ""So glad to meet you,"" she squealed, and I could tell she meant it.",0
"His throat worked, but he didn't question what I knew or the manner in which I'd acquired the information.",0
He shakes his head as he drags his eyes up and down my quivering form during the presentation.,0
Their discomfort lasted for another thirty minutes before Urie pulled off the project and hid the documents out of sight.,0
"Tinker had been observing Sarge sifting through the files and wondered what he was looking for. Her curiosity finally got the better of her and she moved over closer and asked, ""Sarge, what in the hell are you looking for?""",0
"He debated taking the elevator to the main floor, but sometimes it was slower than it should be.",0
He rationalized the situation and knew that this so-called partnership wouldn't stand up in any board meeting that he recognized.,0
"""The cultural norms for remote working are different here,"" Amy said.",0
"He pulled on a tool belt, sheathed several different-sized tools, then stooped and began to pack supply boxes into one bag and the small bundles of documents into another.",0
"Everything in him screamed to run forward, to wrap his work-hardened hands around that pale contract and tear it to pieces. His cry of rage rose only to gurgle to a halt, never leaving him.",0
I expected to see all of the things Melissa had described about the research lab.,0
"I give him a sharp look, ""You just want to use your theories, don't you?""",0
"They were concerned about the possibility that he has been experimenting with some other substance, perhaps something unknown.",0
He would tense as if bracing himself for my critique. But I would never demean him or touch his work in such a manner.,0
"The dean says somebody spotted her at the library, but not when or which section.",0
It’s important that you acquire this research skill first as you may find it hard to focus while distracted by the discussions around you.,0
"He entered the lecture hall slowly, Dagmar's body arching into his seat while he planted tiny notes against the page and margin.",0
"As is customary among academic instructors, Tumorg employs fear to motivate his students.",0
"Archer's mouth curved in amusement, and I think it was the first time I saw him really smile during peer review.",0
"So when Benedict asked, she said yes even before he had finished his thesis proposal.",0
"It was Sebastian, and in another second he was right by my side, lifting me up off the field. His face was actually still with shock, a fairly tender and overwhelmed expression muddling his features, one completely at odds with the character I was so sure he had as a teammate.",0
"When they laid her arm down by her side, I could see several small, round marks, irregular bruises, and damaged capillaries just under the surface of her skin at the bend of her arm from the intense training.",0
He would have asked if he had needed me to do that in the game.,0
"You report to me, but I want you to work closely with the head coach. I expect this team to grow to championship strength as more players arrive. Schmitt interjected, ""The senior coach in charge at Ysleta is Matt Berkowitz.""",0
"I raised my left arm and with my right index finger I drew a line the length of my forearm, indicating the injury.",0
"I would show the tournament officials Sir Horace's championship deed, which proves that he still holds his title.",0
"Isaac leaned over me, easily lifting me into his arms, my legs wrapped around his waist as he carried me off the court.",0
"I had a hard time keeping up with him through the crowd. People were bumping into me and stuff, but for Chax, they simply stepped aside, letting him pass.",0
"In answer, Max took a game ball from beneath his jacket, and passed it to Tavi.",0
"The players had pitched their tent under one wing of the stadium and the other two men were camped under the opposite wing. Even at this distance, it was clear that the two groups were not fraternizing.",0
She would just be another unsuspecting investor in our little plan and maybe she would come out of this without a blemish.,0
"He took a step closer to me and jabbed the business card in the air again, pink ink falling off it and snowing onto the floor below.",0
"""I think I can remember anything you have to tell me,"" stated Maximilian crossly.",0
"There you are, young entrepreneur, don't go leaping into the path of the competition.",0
"I wouldn't give Lasseur the satisfaction of agreeing with him, so I just grunted.",0
"She felt like the wings of success were fluttering on her back, encouraging her to tell the truth. It was an odd sensation and caught her completely off-guard.",0
"Jessica ran through all the bad deals she knew in her head. As soon as the investor had headed for the hors d'oeuvres, Jessica walked over to Clarence and, in a whisper, and still smiling, called him several of them.",0
"""We just have to get used to this office,"" he said, staring up at the walls and then at the floors.",0
"Annwyl glared at Brastias and Morfyd, huddled together in a corner watching her pitch the idea.",0
"If he did not release his hold on her soon, she would suffer an aneurysm and lose the deal.",0
"He picked up the report, lifted up the lid to the middle console, and dropped the document down inside. Then he returned his attention back to rummaging around in the briefcase.",0
"He had many allies during his long career, and it was not the first time he had been betrayed by the opposition. Max and Jennie stood in the crowd and quietly watched the procession lead the senator out, with Jennie giving her a glare of contempt.",0
"He talks with a funny accent and Sir Horace says that is because he lived in a different district before he became Sir Horace's aide. Edmund was only seven when he left home and went to live in Sir Horace’s office, which is very young to start work.",0
"Sydney stood at the hearing room edge, one shirt sleeve bloodied but the other arm extended. With a mark-fueled protest, Eve surged up and toward her, catching Sydney's hand and gripping it tightly.",0
"He kept ignoring her until she brought a hand up and rubbed her chest in discomfort. His eyes snapped up, and he looked on with focused interest.",0
I will step down as soon as you reach the podium.,0
"For seven days Budhil refused to acknowledge the presence of his rival. He acted as though the dark horse candidate was not in his election headquarters, even when Cadfeal tried to ask questions of him. Daksha would check in on him frequently, but his visits were short and mostly perfunctory.",0
"It's led me to believe that what you and I need is a real coalition, with real people. As much as I enjoy talking to you, darling, this isn’t ever going to work.",0
"I turned off the microphone to hear better, but it was quiet.",0
"He spoke quietly, yet there was absolute command in his voice.",0
He crossed over to the window and gazed at the gallery below.,0
She climbed in and sat uncomfortably next to a canvas bag.,0
"As we prepare for a new exhibition, we ask you for courage and creativity.",0
"Truly, this is a day that improves with the passing. You may not like Fiacail, but he was correct in saying you need to rest. If you sleep, your creativity will refresh, and you will create more rapidly.",0
"He twisted his brush in his hand, swinging it to the side.",0
"I took it and let her help me up, wincing as I felt my back, shoulder, and the entire left flank of my upper body beginning to bruise from the long hours painting.",0
"Jenks complained as I wrapped my legs around the easel, steadying it.",0
"It was all masterpieces, and he smiled, revealing gold and silver paints. The hardest part about holding a winning portfolio is the waiting. You know you're going to change the art world, but no one else does.",0
He disappeared into the studio just to come out running a few moments later with several artists yelling after him. He had grabbed a warm coat for Taylor on his way out.,0
"Duke reached across the table, grabbed Goodspeed by the collar, and pulled. As Ken struggled, Duke reached into Goodspeed's art bag and removed the exclusive gallery invitation he found there.",0
"I tried wrenching my arm back, tried to pull her out, away from the harsh feedback closing in on all sides.",0
"On the first day that Zora found out about Lea, Lea started wearing headphones more frequently, to avoid anyone else recognizing her.",0
"I shook my head, instantly flashing back to when I'd thought the same thing about Jack—that he had cheated at the music competition—but Cole was really to blame for the misunderstanding.",0
He managed to move his head slightly to look around at his surroundings in the studio.,0
"She scanned the street for signs of life, some were busking, some leaving gigs, none were sufficient for their audience.",0
"I turned my head to one side and kissed the pulse in her wrist, then gently clasped her hands with mine as we swayed to the music.",0
"Shay pounded on the door and was about to yell for help when the musician stopped laughing and called out to him, ""Shai, Shai, Shai my son. Has it been so long that you don’t recognize me? I’ve come here to help you not scare the devil into you.""",0
"I kissed Doyle first, and he had to bend down to help me do it, then I kissed Rhys. He looked at me, and there was sadness on his face.",0
"He had thought that for as long as he had known her, though he had never told Qasim this, of course.",0
"He kissed her back, then pulled her concert tee from her body. He laid it over his near their feet, then he tucked her hair around her shoulders where his lips continued tracing. She felt his breath along her collarbone, and then at her neck as they swayed to the rhythm.",0
"I dismissed him, sadly, I think, and rudely and thoughtlessly, and I had a sense of him hovering near me, watching me, as I went on organizing the event.",0
"She tried to concentrate, but she could only think that Birgitte had been right all along about the community meeting.",0
The volunteer stooped and unwound the banner's rope from the peg.,0
They begin to make display booths and community stands for promoting local businesses.,0
He knelt by her side and cradled her head tenderly after the fall at the park cleanup.,0
"He was disgusted at how easily he lost his calm demeanor during the neighborhood meeting. He went into a breathing exercise, timing his inhalations and exhalations. The first thing was to figure out where he was.",0
"Back in the house, Cady sauntered into the kitchen and sat down with a small sigh next to Nate on one of the stools at her tall island countertop, discussing the upcoming block party.",0
"I ignored his less-than-subtle hint that I should reconcile with Chance. I liked Chuch, but he didn't see the big picture. He didn't know I'd spent two weeks in intensive care due to anxiety.",0
"Peter turned and winked at Michael, then made for the community center stairs.",0
"We also have fingerprint, retinal, and ID checks to enter the community meeting room, and have to step through special security gates. Beetee has to leave his wheelchair outside, although they provide him with another once we're through security.",0
Talon thought about the groundbreaking research and felt a twinge of envy.,0
"It was something he had been contemplating for a while now, and he knew what hypothesis he wanted to test.",0
"Yet, the fact that I hadn't already been dismissed from the project was a good sign, and though his expression more or less remained unchanged, there was a spark of curiosity in his eyes.",0
"She walked past him with her arms wrapped around herself, laughed, and shivered, thinking about the cold lab conditions.",0
Ash frowned at him as those words pricked at the times in his life when he’d been brought back to the project against his will.,0
"He rushed forward to help the fallen figure, and found himself grabbing hold of a hand that was nothing more than polished bone, smooth and rather yellowed like an old specimen.",0
"For the next couple of days, Neste rose at the same time and walked to the research center on her crutches. Glynis and her mentor both disapproved, but Neste needed that much independence. Her leg ached constantly, but it also got stronger every day.",0
He wondered if she needed to know any of the data.,0
"Toward the end of the day, Eddie had found a bright yellow sample beside the road and had picked it for her.",0
"It doesn't matter if she goes home exhausted, since her parents are out at some scientific conference and won't be back until Monday. Coby's off with their grandparents, but Tex had been allowed to stay alone.",0
"I think all of us are too overloaded these days. Available time is scarce, so it's a good day if any of us have had one decent break.",0
"Stenn had spent most of his life seeing the collaboration between Samuel and Marianne. That kind of partnership is what he had wanted to feel in his own career. There's another promise for you, Tania, Stenn thought, we'll be as successful as they once were, if we're not already.",0
"I wouldn't have thought that anyone could reboot after that much coding. But Shiro drew in a ragged breath, and blinked open one eye. The other had been exposed to too much blue light, and his eyelid looked sunken and strange.",0
The project leads all agreed that they could not leave until the situation with the database was somehow clarified.,0
"He called out to the others on the team, but there was no reply.",0
They strolled down the corridor and reached the entrance to the server room.,0
"His hand stroked the smooth surface of the touchpad there and, without further urging, slid over to my inner thigh.",0
"We must always complete our tasks with no hesitation and with no errors. Our hearts must not rule our code or our actions. In our line of work, it can only bring bugs.",0
"My heart started pounding when I thought of the way he’d glared at me the other night, through his webcam.",0
"This way we had a better chance of meeting a wide variety of users in the hope of finding some positive beta testers. Although the morning's code reviews were okay, we were really only going through the motions as we had no intention of pushing updates.",0
He turned to look at them as they logged off and Freya glanced over her shoulder back to him. Their eyes locked for a brief second before she broke the contact and turned her head forward once more.,0
"A little dumbstruck, he slowly closed the messaging app and the rest of the world out, and successfully closed himself in with this follower who had come out of nowhere and changed a big part of the strategy.",0
"So far his follower has been mum, but I've managed to learn a good deal about what's trending below Ashwood.",0
"There’s a strong possibility that the rest of the server is unstable. It may explain why they seem unconcerned about guarding it. However, I believe it’s our best chance of getting in without being detected.",0
"We do need to have a talk and figure some things out, though.",0
I didn't miss the torment in his eyes as he averted his gaze from the notifications.,0
"Yet when speaking her last request to him, to tell the moderator good-bye, she used his first name. Had she finally reached some level of respect for him?",0
"After turning off the notifications, he readied for the night with a swift efficiency born of years of social media management.",0
"She curated her profile candlelight in preparation for a special visit from her influencer mother. After showing Millie how to prepare the post with the right amount of hashtags, she published it. It was her mother that had taught her to add relevant tags to her content.",0
"The sight of it did nothing but deepen her fury, and she typed toward him with her fingers clenched.",0
"She turned and walked quickly away, Choja's eyes following her across the office.",0
"Lamare was looking at him, shooting daggers with her eyes during the meeting.",0
"I wasn't exactly the type that people opened up to at work, so I wasn't sure what to do with that information.",0
He allowed himself to savor the moment and just looked at her repeatedly without a word during the presentation.,0
"He asked, and she could hear the uncertainty in his voice over the conference call.",0
"He finally tore his intense gaze from Ash's face and fastened it on her, but thankfully the rigid line of his jaw relaxed a bit as he looked at her.",0
"After they were gone, he examined where they had come from and found a hidden file that opened a secure drive, leading to another folder. More hackers were coming, and he almost got caught, jumping into the data from the edge of the network, the IT team hot on his trail.",0
"I glanced up, and the first thing I saw was a middle-aged man in a suit with a fine silk tie and an expression seriously at odds with the thoroughly wealthy air that he emanated. I just snorted and did not bother to answer Amanda.",0
"As soon as the door clicked closed, Edna leapt for the phone.",0
"He was safely in his company car before he realized that he had bought the software quite legitimately online, it looked more expensive than it really was, she must have something else on him.",0
"Finally, they were allowed to rise, and Rurik kicked into full academic dean mode, demanding an assessment of all faculty and issuing rules for students and staff. He had a few tasks for me—more actions that made me seem scholarly—before finally declaring I could leave.",0
"She realized that she could still see the glow of her research desk lamp, but then it was blotted out as the professor investigated that, too.",0
Kim merely shook her head and continued to stare out of the classroom window.,0
He slid his finger down and drew teasing circles around the edge of the lecture notes.,0
"Surely you can find a way to skim off the current grant funds? Bioengineering is going to be the thing of the future, and here we are, sitting on a virtual gold mine!",0
"""You need to be careful when you go home to visit,"" Michelle declared matter-of-factly.",0
"Professor Boone was yelling at the two graduate students on the research field. From the past, there was an academic proverb that even the dean had a mentor.",0
"I asked my advisor and mentor to wait with my group while I quickly searched for Lyle. He was soaked in coffee by the time I discovered his whereabouts. A glance over my shoulder revealed my team, eyes wide and mouths covered.",0
"Claire wondered whether to comment on her colleague's pasty complexion, stark against the pillar-box red hair.",0
"She gestured discreetly for him to give her his presentation pointer, which he handed over reluctantly.",0
"They loved pointing out she looked nothing like her mom. With Eliza's warm smile and delicate features, Hannah understood everyone's infatuation with her mother. Even dressed in old workout gear and running shoes like she wore now, her mother still looked stunning.",0
The four teammates packed their gear and left the stadium before anyone had a chance to accuse them of anything.,0
"His tiny mom was a beautiful woman, but the heavy, overdone stage makeup made her look a lot older than her twenty-eight years and he hated when she teased her hair out for events. It made her look cheap, and his mom was anything but.",0
"So the Lipwig fellow thought he controlled the team, did he? Well, you couldn't run the team without Mavolio Bent, and by this time tomorrow he, Cosmo Lavish, would own Mr. Bent.",0
"""I am not about to hand you over to them,"" Lexel whispered. Zero would normally have been amazed by anyone noticing his proximity without having seen him, but right now he was preoccupied with the game at hand.",0
It was then that the coach explained that under no circumstances were they to change the strategy that Varvara had devised.,0
"She tried to imagine the middle-aged coach, who harbored a generous heart beneath her no-nonsense, businesslike exterior, benching David Thornton. The injuries that Belle was recovering from had definitely weakened her, leaving her open to the possibility of stepping down from coaching.",0
"Marielle stared after him and wondered what that was about. Then suddenly he spun lightly on his heel and approached her once more. ""Meet me for breakfast at the Steel Dragon,"" he invited.",0
"After a few words, all three players were grinning ear to ear, and the whole team walked down to the locker rooms.",0
"""Jake, I'm sorry to tell you that nowadays that's just the way some athletes like to look."" He put his hand on Jake's shoulder and this time Jake did not object, maybe that was progress.",0
"It looked like I wasn't going to get a lot out of the investor, meaning I had to take a bit of extreme measures to secure the funding.",0
It was at that moment in time he had started to feel the urge to protect his startup. His eyes darkened in jealousy when she pitched to other venture capitalists.,0
"Since he didn't want to talk about the business model, of course I couldn't let it go. That aspect of my entrepreneurial psyche explained a great deal about my relationship with Chance.",0
Some of the partners were lending their aid in getting everything situated properly for the product launch.,0
"She avoided the critical feedback, but her unsteady balance caused her to fall backwards, landing with a thud.",0
"I can get blacklisted from the industry just for harboring her. More importantly, I could get a hefty reward for reporting her to the nearest compliance officer.",0
"""I say we walk there and ask for help,"" Vanida declared the next morning at the startup incubator.",0
They could hear shouts in the waiting area as the former presenters piled into the hallway. Victor walked up the suddenly-deserted aisle to the back row and sat down in a vacated seat.,0
"He asked as he brought forth a large portion of the budget for them to review. He laid it down to form a proposal around the core ideas and looked at her. ""Um, sure,"" she said, unsure of what she could contribute.",0
"The others contemplated this, mulled it over, and decided she was probably right about the market strategy.",0
"He will try to persuade you, perhaps he will try to undermine you. I have extricated you from scandal, Felton; I have caused you to be named senator; I once saved your career, you know on what occasion.",0
"He had done well, and his intelligence had proven highly pertinent to the legislation.",0
"I had been numb, and it was the only thing that made me feel again. On the sixth day, her fever broke and the shivering stopped. I was asleep in the chair, holding her hand when I felt her in my head and sat up.",0
"She herself took a step backwards as another great blow shook the chamber. From beneath the widening crack, she heard them: voices, proclamations, hymns, chants, urges, each one brimming with purpose, each purpose rife with political maneuvering.",0
"Something had to be done, even if it meant deviating from the agenda.",0
"We have tried to wriggle out of it, but without success. We hope that you will pick the locks that we have been unable to open in this policy.",0
I laughed while we lifted our campaign materials and paid 20 dollars from my side and 20 from her side.,0
"She could only hope she would do well enough to impress Santino, the party leader.",0
"On at least one occasion, after surviving a political ambush during a debate in Uzbekistan, Horsa had a herd of 300 promises butchered and left them to rot in the spotlight.",0
He held a policy draft in one hand and a gavel in the other.,0
"He carried me down to his studio, opened the door for me, and gently placed me inside. He set up my easel, and I weakly rolled my eyes at the gesture.",0
He didn't see the critique coming until she'd handed it to him. But he was fast—too fast—and turned just in time to have it pierce his ego instead of his confidence.,0
"He took my elbow, but let go of it again at once when he saw the look in my eyes as I approached the canvas.",0
"Avalon turned to face me, his expression still hard and angry over the art piece.",0
I vaguely remembered hearing someone mention another gallery attached to this one underground but had no idea what or who was housed there.,0
"On leaving the exhibition, Hamish noted that the urgency of unloading his artwork seemed to be understood. Someone had unwrapped his sculptures, but left the paintings untouched. After the initial display of action the interns were now, presumably, arranging things in the gallery, as they were nowhere to be seen.",0
"I have to be there for the brush and administer the finishing touches as soon as possible. Right now both seem to be in Venice, Italy, but have separated. We know the general area at least and our first target is the brush.",0
"I had meant it to be sarcastic, but my mom nodded, totally serious. A car had pulled up outside, and Takata headed for the art supplies.",0
"He sounded like a little boy who didn't get his way, and actually started to look like it when he stamped his feet a few times after his piece wasn't accepted.",0
"""I save your artwork and this is the gratitude I get?""",0
"""I wanted to walk under the stars with you,"" she said. ""I'm glad I could accommodate you,"" I said, as we began walking again down Rook Street, turning on Taurus, past venues that were closing up for the night.",0
"She felt almost drunk, but alive as never before, connected to a man who seemed desperate for her, like a musician finding the perfect harmony.",0
"He found himself humming a verse of a song about a big haul of fish, a tune that his mother used to sing to him before he went to sleep.",0
"""Let's get this over with,"" the bandleader remarked to Oaka. Then he stretched a little bit before he hunkered down on his side of the stage, ready to perform. Oaka quickly took his own stance, hoping that he was ready for this.",0
"Musicians entered and exited from both sides throughout the day. All wore similar outfits and carried their instruments the same way, rendering them indistinguishable from each other. It was so confusing I almost gave up keeping track of them.",0
"At first, she hadn't recognized that face for the luscious contradiction it was. She had seen only the innocence, and had continued searching for someone with the qualities she'd always found most attractive: brooding, dangerous, and soulful.",0
"Her two brothers, musicians in their own right, were grown men with bands of their own and visited often, bringing their partners and bandmates to share in noisy, cheerful jam sessions that lasted well into the night.",0
"In all likelihood, Dan will expect us to stick together. He will check here first, since we have spent most of our time rehearsing here.",0
"His eyes strayed, threatening to return to the computer, so I poked him again with my foot, urging him to focus on the music.",0
"Once in the Capitol region, he left the interstate and began navigating the one-way streets near her place. He never liked city driving, but it didn't dampen his excitement one bit, especially knowing he'd be attending a live concert.",0
"I ended with a hopeful lift to my voice, and then expectantly waited for his response at the community meeting.",0
"I was then sent to volunteer at a community center to be apprenticed there, and after five months that also came to an end. All the time I was pining for my home neighborhood and the familiar faces. Back home, I wasn’t very popular as I had failed to complete my assignment.",0
"The volunteer shrugs and says, ""Get involved and zip it up.""",0
"He was only five years old, and Celeste was rather surprised the first time he showed up at the community festival. His little face was flush, and the first thing he said to her was, ""Hello.""",0
Sumi looked up at him with a bright smile that wrenched his gut. She kissed Kalea's cheek and handed her off to his grandmother before excusing herself to organize the event.,0
"He lowered her carefully to her feet, but she had no strength in them and slumped back over his shoulder at the neighborhood block party.",0
"Pheidippus of Calymne flew into a rage within minutes of his arrival when he was told he would have to camp among the rest of the participants. He took it as a personal insult: other leaders are housed, so why should he not be?",0
"Well, now he would just have to deal with the consequences of not attending the town hall meeting.",0
Jasper released his hold on her and helped her to her feet.,0
"I only mention all this as a window to our minds at that time, so you can sense how we were thinking during the community planning.",0
"Several months earlier, he had seen her flip her wrist, sending an attacking particle through the air in the lab.",0
"As far as Dali was aware, he had only a handful of half-siblings in other research teams, none of whom he had ever met.",0
"Marcus stared at the back of the young researcher's head for a moment. If Lady Aquitaine saw Crassus like this, she'd be hard-pressed to hide her satisfaction. He could be no threat to her protégé Arnos's scientific achievements, like this.",0
"He found it still hard to breathe and he constantly turned, listening to voices from the darkness calling him in scientific jargon that one time, he was sure, he had known.",0
"Mrs. Wilson has always been good to you students, and you should show some respect.",0
"Quinn didn't say anything, and for that, I was grateful. My thoughts were a mess, going fifty different ways, and right then, I didn't have a hope of coping with any sort of scientific discussion.",0
"She drew her scalpel, blindly cutting the test samples that tried to contaminate his experiment. Immediately, the other samples corrupted her workstation and closed in to contaminate her experimental setup again and again, and again. She felt the contamination spread beneath her gloves.",0
"Later, as Ariel thought more about her collaboration with Baldur, she started to wonder if it wouldn't be logical for her to be gathering more data, not less.",0
"My anxiety increased tenfold when I stepped outside and saw Bryce's pickup in my lab's parking lot. I definitely wasn't looking forward to dealing with Bryce again. Jace tried to talk and joke around during the ride, but Bryce's crabby mood put a damper on any attempt at scientific conversation.",0
Hauk waited until the other researchers were gone before he knocked the one unfortunate research assistant who'd been left behind unconscious.,0
I was selfish to ask him to carry out what should be my programming task.,0
"The third programmer pulled out two crescent-shaped devices from the folds of his beige hoodie and slashed at her. Her layered code was too cumbersome for her to dart away fast enough, so as he swiped for her script, she bent back.",0
"Some people have zero clue as to what they’re doing with their code, and then when you add in feelings and the whole new and exciting startup thing, it just makes everything better.",0
"His fanaticism rekindled, and he made an ill-fated trip to Silicon Valley and a controversial meeting.",0
"If I am to keep my tech startup and regain their loyalty, I need to defeat this competitor in open market battle.",0
"Keeping his stolen data became an obsession for him, and the plan he devised to hide it had to be foolproof.",0
"She moaned in her sleep, as if she had been reading his mind and was now agreeing with every word he said. Satisfied with his conclusion, Aidan settled further back and rested against the bed’s headboard. After a minute had passed, he fell asleep with a clear mind.",0
"In his teenage years, Jackson had relied upon his large frame and fast hands. He would earn some additional income from tech gigs and coding competitions. The bruises on his mentor’s face resembled the mental exhaustion he would receive from being hit with complex algorithms.",0
"Thomas wasn’t sure what he thought about having Victor as a witness, but he didn’t really want to wait as they went to search out another validation.",0
"When the server doors opened fully, Kelly and I exchanged the same freaked-out expression.",0
"I danced a jig amusedly, watching Ben get more and more agitated as his followers increased their negative comments.",0
"He held her account open with his fingers, nuzzling his phone against her, his hair sweeping across the sensitive screen.",0
I saw the smoke of your viral post and knew you must no longer be offline.,0
"Things did seem to be going well for a while, until one day I noticed something strange on my feed.",0
"It is a risk, yes, but one we can afford to take. The only difference between going to them and letting them come to us, is when we engage with them online.",0
"I could only do so much and decided to focus on my profile picture. I turned the cold water on and splashed my face, scrubbing it roughly. Once it was clean, or at least clear of mud and makeup, I focused on my hair.",0
"He uttered a shocked cry and crawled away on his hands and knees from the aggressive comments. Hoots kicked him in the chest, flipping him onto his back.",0
He glanced at Karl again and saw a look of panic on the student's face as he read the heated discussion.,0
"Thank you, officer, for letting me make a fool of myself and convincing you that I'm a nut-job. When it was time to go outside and get into her car, Phoebe stuck her head out the front door and looked both ways before going all the way outside.",0
"""You have to be very careful with that thing,"" warned Rebecca, referring to the trending hashtag.",0
"These words didn't sound like Diana at all, or at least not like the Diana that Cassie had known at the office.",0
"Without knocking, he turned the knob and let himself into a small but elegant meeting room.",0
"Supervisor Iris spared her a slight nod, but he watched only for physical threats. ""Your wariness will be of no use against me, Warden."" In Edon's study, Taya sat demurely on the edge of the chair Edon offered her, her hands crossed on her knee.",0
"Now she could see the speaker, she realized the voice didn't even sound like his usual tone during presentations.",0
"The employees who'd followed them had resigned, been replaced, their positions eliminated.",0
"He yelled at one man who tossed several files haphazardly into a drawer. ""Those are critical documents; you must treat them with care."" The man mumbled an apology and then returned inside the office for more.",0
"Hector had never been disregarded, but his ideas had been ignored countless times. He knew the total devastation of feeling helplessness, the terror of being trapped in your role as other people overshadow your contributions.",0
"As she expected, the team made a pyramid of their chairs next to the pillar; but as soon as any of them got to within a couple of feet of the top, he was unable to defend himself against her critique.",0
"Nolen pulled on his blazer, stuffing it into his still unbuttoned trousers.",0
"Allrianne sighed dramatically but turned and did as he asked, trailing off into the lobby. Elend turned back to Sazed, who was watching the girl with a curious expression.",0
"""We would congratulate you on your publication,"" the dean intoned, his scholarly image appearing in the projector's light.",0
"Hacking his way through dense literature with determination, Eladio approached his father's study with pride. When his younger siblings saw the pile of books resting benignly on Eladio's shoulders, they screamed with delight.",0
"Amara's frustration faded, taking with it whatever motivation she had left for the project.",0
"She glared at him, then promptly returned to the others. They had been given one textbook to share, which she eyed longingly.",0
"Abby stepped away from her husband's crouched figure and headed into the library. When she reached the counter next to the checkout machine, she slid open the top drawer and sifted through the papers inside using the light of her cellphone.",0
She had wondered if Professor Carthinal had wanted to see Yssa to make some romantic assignation.,0
"The ground around them trembled, and Rhona realized that Vigholf had moved a chair close so that Professor Agrippina could sit. He smiled at Rhona, quite proud of himself, and she knew in that moment—she loved him. Professor Agrippina sat on the chair and gave Vigholf a nod of thanks.",0
"""As much as I would like to participate in your research, Jack, it is impossible.""",0
"Personally, Duke didn't believe Shock was secretly advocating for equity while pretending to serve traditional academia. Shock merely placated both sides, knowing the winning side would put him in a tenured position eventually.",0
He answered their questions as quickly and as effortlessly as he had the others.,0
There was no way he could have gone outside and locked the gym from the other side without a key.,0
She closed her eyes against the bright afternoon light from the stadium.,0
"She is damnably clever, and horribly persistent, I grant you that. He scowled, while Arpan wagged a knowing finger his way.",0
"The coach grunted and hit the stopwatch, and then they pulled out of practice. The steam from the athlete's breath streamed back directly into Magnus's face. He lifted a finger and redirected it away.",0
That would just about give us enough time to sprint out of the entrance before the dust cloud from the collision obscured my vision completely.,0
"She turned and smiled at Alex before looking at her teammates. Her tone had become almost exuberant, her unseen anger subsided for the moment. ""What each of you need to understand is that there is nothing that could stop him if he wanted to take the win.""",0
Her coach wiped the smile off her face as he tore her a new one for being late to practice.,0
"I'm about to tell the referee that is carrying out my penalty the truth about my abilities—a betrayal of myself, but I feel like he needs to know. He looks at me without saying a word, his eyebrows raised.",0
Arthur exclaimed as he picked himself up out of the corner of the locker room.,0
She knew it like she knew her hands were connected to her arms. And she couldn't pass up the only opportunities she'd ever have to experience this championship.,0
"For the first time in his life, he didn't know how he was going to handle something in the business.",0
"He fought against the urge to lean into her, to bring her in closer to the negotiation table.",0
"Ridcully tried to look as dignified as possible, given his startup's situation.",0
"You'd have to let her go eventually, and then what? She wouldn't trust Simon anymore, and she already doesn't trust you because you took over her project.",0
"Except for the organization, no one knew what her new product looked like.",0
"A young entrepreneur could, with encouragement and training, eventually manage to pitch the entire business plan after just one session. This is an important social attribute when you're starting out.",0
"She was dead weight on the project and her commitment was slippery, but he couldn't let go. With one arm wedged around the core team, he was secure but Cathy was still suspended above the critical deadline.",0
I rummaged through the office supply cabinet and found some of my sister's promotional lip gloss.,0
"She was young for him, but ten years or so wasn't the end of the world in terms of business experience.",0
"The crowd of investors parted, bowing frantically, as she passed through to slip into the boardroom.",0
Sarah shook her head and reached out with a limp hand during the press conference.,0

He turned to find her with a briefcase full of documents and reports that have been a staple of their policy discussions for as long as he could remember.,0
"I sigh miserably, then focus my effort on the political wounds, broken alliances, and ruptured support base. It would be for the best if I stepped down, but I can't give up on the campaign.",0
Peter went to the back of the car pulling the minister with him as they hurried off the motorcade.,0
She caught it with one hand and used the other to open the door to the Senate chamber.,0
"She didn't ruin everything that made him the politician he was. He marched to debate for his constituents, Anna, to uphold his platform, but first for you. The man would have stood alone and argued against an entire opposition party for his country, for you, Anna.",0
"I didn't mean to be so blunt, but I was worried about the election results.",0
"He has agreed to share his strategy secrets in exchange for his support. Lord Ran steps forward and holds up the economic plan for the governor to admire. As the governor lifts the document, the lights in the chamber flicker off the glossy cover, making it appear dynamic.",0
"The guilt forced me to look away from him, and I noticed then that Maddie and Doug had stopped their arguing. Maddie was glancing over at the refreshments table, but Doug's eyes were on me.",0
"""No, we're just supposed to make sure you attend the show,"" he replied, although he was eyeing the artworks hungrily. ""Well, I’m not looking at any of this until I know it's worth my time,"" said Tara, folding her hands under her chest.",0
"Her hands were in her coat pockets, and she didn't hurry; she stopped to admire some pieces in a gallery window, checked out the exhibit at Le Cirque.",0
"In return for her artistic services, she only asked that her granddaughter be enrolled in their elite art school.",0
"Dardan stood, glad that the curator was not one to needlessly prolong ceremony.",0
"""I see Ethan's father didn't exaggerate everyone's current disdain for his latest painting,"" Saundra said. ""Please understand I don't give a shit what you think about his work right now.""",0
Tonight was no exception as he entered the gallery sporting a vivid red scarf with the smell of paint on his hands.,0
She ignored the surge and crash of bitter emotions that awoke with the mention of the critic's name.,0
"I thought someone on the other side might be doing exactly the same thing. Of course, I should look to see who was standing there, appreciating the artwork.",0
"This didn't make for a happy young artist, and his parents could tell he was unhappy and tried to find the reason. Johnathon, being afraid of more criticism from his instructor, kept it all to himself.",0
"I flew backwards and my head hit the studio floor, the pain overwhelming, but all I could think about was saving Susan's painting. I scrambled back up and then cried out in horror as the thief leaped into the night, carrying it like a rag doll into the darkness.",0
It was obvious that the time to ponder and dwell had passed and the performance was upon us.,0
"Every argument, every hurt feeling, every jam session we've spent together led up to this moment.",0
"Thorne was staggering right behind him, hitting the sound equipment on both sides like a drunken man, sweat pouring down into his eyes.",0
"""You could safely leave your band's rehearsal now,"" she says slyly, nodding in my direction.",0
"Eldo called out to one of the band members as he tried to get up. ""Can someone lend me a pick or --"" Ama pushed him down and cried, ""Are you crazy?""",0
"It was like she only cared if you messed up a note. It's good to not let musicians' egos get too big. Vianez opened her mouth to say something to Reynold, but Blana stopped her.",0
"Once he rounded the stage door, he did run, but not for the bathroom. He took the first flight of stairs and started down it, two steps at a time.",0
"After a while, she said, ""What they consider music has to evolve sometime.""",0
"When his fingers dug into the strings, dragging her beneath the melody, she knocked her forehead against his. He bellowed with rage, until she squirmed around and drove her elbow back into his notes.",0
"I lowered my voice, even though I knew Rebecca was just as involved with our band meeting as we were.",0
They stayed like that until the meeting room door opened again and she heard Fearghus's voice.,0
"Rafe nodded bemusedly in agreement, but when he turned to Rand it was with a lingering frown about the community project.",0
"""Excuse me, sir,"" called out one of the crowd, in a courteous and friendly tone, ""Would you pull over to the side, please, and let us pass?""",0
Both of his parents were firm believers in better living through community action.,0
"He knew the man holding him and those with him had the advantage in numbers, so he kept it hidden and waited for the proper opportunity to put it to use. All remained silent in the community center at the top of the stairs.",0
It disturbed him more than he would admit that Nicolette was not there at the neighborhood event.,0
"Men like him could mobilize entire communities for funding and support. And for hundreds of years since then, he has fought rival groups, bureaucratic demons, and enemies of community progress.",0
"She then wrapped her arms around my neck and asked, ""How are you?"" after the long outreach event.",0
We had been through so much together in this past year of organizing community activities.,0
"Lucien left the town hall and returned to the abandoned alleyway, where he once again dematerialized into the spirit realm. He flashed to Anya's next volunteering location - and found her in a community park.",0
Laurette glanced from Brina to Evalle with eyes begging for help interpreting the lab results.,0
"I allowed her aura to flow through me, her data becoming my own. I could feel her concern and fear, her regret at having to challenge my theory, and her determination to protect the integrity of our research at all costs.",0
"She felt an excited shiver shoot up her spine and warm the entire core of her being before she asked, ""Love, it will be quicker to let me review your research notes.""",0
"He couldn't recall it being done in his lifetime, but the circumstances justified the experimental procedure.",0
"She gave a cry of relief when she saw him, then stopped when she saw the research assistant by his side.",0
"""In a year, I'll expect you to pay me my dues as your mentor, and such accolades to you will cease.""",0
"She said as she stood up to get the first aid kit. After she finished bandaging the subject and putting splints on both parts of his broken leg, she was beyond exhaustion from the fieldwork.",0
"""Now I realize that even a renowned scientist can't get everything right! I try to learn from other researchers more, and even from students! So what I'm saying is, maybe I'm really more progressive now than I was then!""",0
"As they sat before a roaring fire in the university lounge that night, swapping stories of the day’s experiments, Jay felt himself right at home and eager to know more of his colleagues, and strangely, the academic world in general.",0
"Miko found the broken sensor, and tossed it down to James. Catching it, James raised it up toward the monitoring system in the ceiling. Holding it steady, he put the end against the design and pressed firmly.",0
"Today's developers thought that the company's policy on open-source contributions was too generous, apparently. Today's developers wanted to work on cutting-edge projects and had conveniently decided that Magnus's tech stack was outdated, every bit of it.",0
"She looked up and caught the eye of a cheery-looking middle-aged woman. Sheltering in the doorway, she gave Beth a warm welcome. ""Come inside quickly, love, and get out of the rain you're soaking. And let's discuss that new startup idea you've been working on.""",0
"Hell, it was one of the things our tech consultancy was known for, and I knew I was justifying what I would do next. I stood up so I could reach across the desk and touch his laptop.",0
He transports himself as a pure algorithm and assumes digital form as needed. People fear him because he speaks directly into their devices and hacks those who don't comply.,0
"I turned and saw Avril and Pepper coming up the street. Pepper left her side and ran to meet her colleague. Avril walked slowly toward us, and I could tell something was wrong with the latest update.",0
"He pulled away from her and gave her a murderous look, but she knew he wouldn't dare do anything to the project. He led his team out of the office with as much dignity as a weasel.",0
A notification on my phone jerked me out of my thoughts.,0
I was surprised no one had questioned what Gideon's IT team was doing there.,0
"There was no clear reason that she could think of. She scanned the logs for any issues with Laila's code, but there were none.",0
"Instead, Edana had snatched an iPad from the chair in the corner of the room and handed it to him with a poorly hidden smile. Jesse flashed an angered and confused look, but took the iPad anyway.",0
He then changed his mind and got pissed at me for not wanting him to give up his dream of becoming a viral influencer.,0
"I worked there as a community manager for twelve years, and at first, I liked it a lot.",0
"Seeing him, wanting him, and being rejected by him for the thousandth time had held no appeal, so she'd done the unthinkable. She'd gone to her mother's to receive a mental shredding she would actually survive, posting every detail on her Instagram story.",0
"She could cope with Daniel being a bad loser; he'd been like that all year, but if the others also thought she'd done something wrong in the group chat, then she needed to think it over.",0
"Paul realized that although he hadn't meant to focus his ability, his anger at Hodge had taken over. Realizing his mistake too late, he watched as the man panicked even further and slammed the car in reverse, pulling out of the driveway with a screech, while his livestream was still running.",0
"I watched without breathing, waiting for that deadly post to reach up and destroy my reputation. But instead, Nathan did something I could not have expected—he defended me in the comments.",0
"The brand manager offered him two gold ducats for the sponsored post, which is the price Pigafetta paid for a rat when starving, but the man still wanted a higher engagement rate.",0
"Before Orris could start the campaign with a hard slap on the ad spend, Anson whispered to the nervous novice influencer and stroked her confidence.",0
"The algorithm changes really took a lot out of the social media community, but left us alone. With us being so fortunate, we’ve been running the support group dry trying to help some of the shadow-banned and displaced creators.",0
"""We are most glad that you are able to join us,"" he said during the live-streamed panel discussion.",0
"We were both lifted again on chairs, as we had been before, and hurriedly carried out of the conference room, leaving the meeting behind us.",0
"Ivana stepped into view before Jordan from the cover of gathered cubicles. When she was not far from Jordan, she endeavored to hand her the documents with her gloved hands. Jordan hindered her twice with the help of the whiteboard marker.",0
"She exhaled and crossed her skinny arms against her, wearing only a thin cardigan, but nodded.",0

"As he spoke, Bax produced a roll of banknotes from one of his suit's multitude of pockets.",0
"""I know you told me that theory Aidan has, but it still leaves unanswered questions. For instance""—she raised her hand and ticked off her points on her fingers.",0
"Once inside the office doors, Amanda held her jacket closed to hide the coffee stains on her blouse. Hunter remained completely still and silent as Tate pushed the file cart through the bustling areas.",0
"The gathered employees took up the cry, the calls growing for the CEO to entertain them with a tale of his business acumen. The CEO bowed his head diffidently, waved a hand as if to dismiss such calls as foolishness.",0
"She watched the student move closer, his notebook and pen raised and ready. Suddenly, though, he lost his balance on the stairs.",0

I ran back up the stairs and dug out my smallest study guide.,0
All the academic rules of debate will go out the window. You may have to contend with guerilla tactics and a hostile audience.,0
"He thinks it might be an eye strain, but doesn't know for sure. If the drops don't work, then I'm supposed to come back in five days for more tests. Hopefully, you won't have to wear your sunglasses to the lecture on Monday.",0
There were only two flights to Atlanta that night coming from destinations following inbound flights from Paris. He made it to the stadium much earlier than needed just to ensure that nothing was left to chance.,0
"I doubted she bought that strategy, but I really did want to see it in action.",0
"Her body had endured years of training, and now she had finally pushed it to its limits.",0
Muldor gave him his normal blank stare that revealed nothing about the upcoming play.,0
"People were supposed to take deep breaths at the end of a game, she'd remembered. She couldn't remember the last thing she'd said to Luke. Weren't you supposed to remember the last thing you said to a teammate before a big game?",0
"At the break of dawn, she visited Halla on the edge of town. She paid the trainer for a large supply of protein supplements. Halla knew well enough not to ask too many questions, but she could not refrain from saying something before Runa hurried off.",0

She looked back over her shoulder and gave Michael a reassuring smile before entering the pitch meeting.,0
"She was a thorn in his side, a torment to his soul, a problem in need of a solution. He could never be what she needed, never run the business the way she'd want.",0
"I ducked back, dropping to my knees, and rolling out of the way of the aggressive negotiation.",0
"He rested his hand on his briefcase, thinking he would watch him closely during the conference.",0
"I grabbed a business coat and wrapped it around myself to hide my anxious state. We waited in silence until our turn came, answering accordingly when our names were called out. They didn't ask about Nerida, so they obviously knew her startup rate.",0
"One of the men secured Aiden's hands behind his back while the other dashed to combat the trio of competitors. Hagan ducked to avoid a corporate attack from the nearing rival, responding with a strategic move which expeditiously eradicated the threat.",0
"Rather than have given his resources to a total stranger, he would have thought it was their own stupid fault for entering the wrong market. The honesty of the realization gave him a twinge of momentary discomfort.",0
Steffor turned to Vejax who met his eye with an anticipated glare during the board meeting.,0
"When Veshir saw the contract on the table, his expression grew dark. He tied the loose ends to a clause, then trotted over to Renald but said nothing.",0
"I haven't been watching over her progress the way I should, the way I used to. After all, it was Gale who checked our financials, not me.",0
A record is necessary to prove continued efforts to find and salvage any lost support for the policy that has been proposed.,0
"They rushed him at the chamber door, slamming him against it.",0
"Since I was still blocked off from the outside, I had no way of searching for an answer. I wondered if I were still connected to the political advisors if I would have been forewarned about any impending crisis.",0
He held out a small box with a clear top and an envelope. The envelope doesn't have any suspicious markings or anything.,0
A lot of people in the council didn't like me much. I'd go down with Morgan for giving aid and comfort to a political rival. I suddenly felt naive and vulnerable and maybe a little stupid.,0
She explained the newspaper articles in Venezuela that had the effect of undermining the trace of transfers in their national bank.,0
"It was real enough though, only it wasn't considered a good idea to send the high official into the debate, or particularly not in bright attention-grabbing attire.",0
"Lina shook her head and made a grunting noise, while Collin forged ahead in the meeting.",0
"The advisor looked at him in surprise: ""If you are going to debate, this means that things look bad. It is useless to rely on rhetoric in the council.""",0
"I took a deep breath, summoning every ounce of strength I had in me, and wrapped my arms around Alex's neck, linking my fingers together tightly. Alex put his arms around my waist and pushed me so close to him I swear the public opinion was going to weld us together.",0
"And she probably knows it already, but people like that are unwilling to change. That's why they go to art critics in the first place.",0
"Paul had noticed his mentor's presence from the corner of his eye, and it served to give him more courage and conviction. Great Bear had been watching the exhibit escalate from his comfy vantage point; he'd seen Kelly mingling, and the effect it was having on Paul.",0
"She sat on the studio sofa, leaning forward so that her elbows rested on her spread knees.",0
"So on that day we decided, what harm could it do? We pulled one another, for without inspiration the ascent is difficult, and thought we would present ourselves as our father wanted.",0
Jacob and I slowly turned around until we were facing him. Now he didn't look like the artist I saw before at the gallery.,0
"His friend Ted's face was on his canvas, and he watched in horror as his video image licked the red and white paint from his friend's body. Sam tried to remove his video but it was too late—it had already gone viral.",0
"An exotic floral arrangement adorned the middle of the craft table. Kiran walked over to the table and pulled out a chair for me. We were alone so far in the room, and I was thankful for that.",0
"I want them to see progress, I want them to see you finishing up. These folks got a stake in the building of this mural.",0
"Besides, she owed Jessamine something now, and the last thing in the world the other girl wanted to do, clearly, was go home before the exhibit.",0
The local art society is going around and asking people not to attend and avoid the storm at all costs.,0
"Markus turned to see his youngest adopted daughter, Matarina, standing behind him with her violin.",0
"As he stood and turned to leave the stage, a glint of silver caught his attention and he turned back. While White continued to strum chords, Blue slid his hand to his waist and began to draw his guitar pick.",0
"She handled the incoming requests at the southeast stage, and she had realized who the sponsors were targeting: the wealthiest of the patrons, that's who. I was there when she realized it, almost breaking down in a complete fit when she realized her own complicity, and mine.",0
"I glanced over my shoulder, wishing once again I could see the chords. Those affected by the dissonance would have to have appeared different, what was left of their harmony tainted somehow.",0
"Doak Garland embraced me when we reached his spot at the recording booth, his white hands light on my shoulders so he wouldn't hurt me.",0

I grew up beside this neighbor my whole life and we didn’t even talk to each other until yesterday’s block party.,0
"For too long, she'd wondered if he'd found a new community to join.",0
"She had sucked me in, played to my emotions during the committee meeting, and killed my proposal without so much as breaking a sweat.",0
Otis had been unmoving for the last five minutes and his face had turned an ashen gray. Marcia had run to the edge of the park and dipped her handkerchief in the fountain. She tried to soothe Otis by patting the cool cloth on his warm forehead.,0
"I hadn't been able to handle volunteering with him anymore. It had been terrible, seeing someone I care about so much regard me with such contempt and disappointment.",0

"""I do believe you had quite the audience for your first community speech, didn’t you?""",0
I blinked hard and eased myself back on my elbows after setting up for the neighborhood picnic.,0
Danika thought perhaps she was staring at a scientific breakthrough right now.,0
"The loyal researchers fled to the head scientist and told him what was happening, and together they prepared for a major experiment.",0
"Mostly he rearranged the lab equipment, polished a microscope or two, and completely re-organized the specimen samples.",0
"""Wayne?"" she asked softly as they walked toward the research facility.",0
"""These people who funded me, my colleagues, have been waiting for this discovery a very long time.""",0
"Last year, not long after I'd met Seth, I'd discussed some of these same hypotheses with Carter. He'd told me that no one—not even a disgraced scientist—was beyond forgiveness and redemption.",0

"Her throat was tight, her hands were sweaty, and she was still holding onto the edges of her laptop with a fiendish grip. Brick crossed his arms and sighed at her, making a good show of appearing heartily disappointed in her debugging efforts.",0
"Amandie found that some of the teams in the tech company had been quite fond of the retiring CEO, whom she did not know very well herself, whereas others gave a token of respect to his departure, or were clearly indifferent.",0
Alexia realized this must be the true source of Genevieve's frustration with the new software update.,0
"Perry made a grumbling sound at the sight, and I patted her shoulder, hoping that would make her feel better somehow and fully knowing that it wouldn't with the project deadline looming.",0

We even outsmarted her the first time and destroyed her precious algorithm.,0
"I muted him until he stopped spamming, and we blocked his account, flagged his posts, and threw an empty profile over his head. As we finished, Ahmed pulled up with a new account. We slung the troll into the back, hid him under some dummy accounts, and logged out.",0
"He felt as if his hands had been banned, his feet fixed to the timeline. He felt panic at this unholy restriction and struggled to post. Artephius moderated over him, clutching a worn-out meme, his eyes blazing.",0
He assured Orris their team vigilance would allow them the luxury of a viral post.,0
My latest post was nine minutes old and was the beacon of my profile.,0
"Aunt Cord called from the other room, where she was scheduling posts.",0
"He was so hard and fierce in his comments and yet so gentle in his DMs. She wished that she could crawl inside his bio or, more to the point, that she could wrap herself around his profile and keep him from trolls forever.",0
"At this point, it didn't really surprise him that Zoe could sense the trending topic.",0
"He did not see how Taashou caught his falling engagement as he became inactive, how she laid his inactivity gently on his feed within the trending warmth and wrapped it in hashtag blankets.",0
"Then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two accounts that stood a little distance away. They marveled to see with what speed these green-lit profiles now moved, vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye.",0
"I scrolled on, never slowing, not sure where it was I had landed on the feed. I passed Bridget's profile sitting dormant under a sponsored post.",0
"Jensen suddenly realized he just told these colleagues they were alone. He may have held the rank of director, but truth be told, he was just a scientist that needed to outrank the team he was leading.",0
"Jesse clenched his fists, his entire body wanting to go into fight mode, despite the fact that he knew he was outmatched in the meeting. Since learning that Gabby was in serious trouble, and not throwing a spoiled rich tantrum, something primal in him had woken up.",0
"The gate's crank had to be held or locked in place to prevent it from coming back down again, and Murien was determined to save the huddled employees in the break room.",0
It was a rare privilege to select someone from a list of top-ranked candidates.,0
"She watched the project come to completion, and ran to it when it was finished, and pressed herself against the success.",0
"""If we go now, we could probably catch up with them,"" Erin said. When Kota frowned and looked at her sprained wrist, she sighed.",0
"Lina sat in her private office, holding her phone in her hands as she read emails. Across from her, Jaime held their other tablet, never once tempting to put the device down. Will complained that he would spoil her communication habits, and Jaime made no apologies for it.",0
"Clearly my mistake should be rectified, according to some of the people in the office. My eyes find Gabe again as two of the managers start pulling me away from the cubicle, but he's walking away from me.",0
"Even I had to admit, it was almost comforting having him around in the office.",0
"The employees jumped off their desks to organize the workspace, and Olivia could follow their activity, but not enough, so she went forward to look out of another window. Not far away on the corporate grounds, she saw a demonstration and narrated the scenes into her phone.",0
"finishing the proposal, she confidently presented her strategies to boost the department's sales.",1
"he experienced no hesitation in tackling the challenging project, knowing it would propel his career forward.",1
our manager had inquired about the pending project updates with a tone of urgency. an eager mr. Harrison sought clarification on how his innovative idea could be integrated into the final plan.,1

"he sorted through the reports with precise, skillful hands and compiled the crucial data.",1
"Maria stood up, smiled and confidently outlined the project timeline with Sarah taking notes.",1

"I sat down hard on the library chair, opened my laptop, and began my research.",1
she removed her thesis notes from her bag and prepared to discuss her groundbreaking findings.,1
"Rachel didn't say anything as she turned and continued on her way. she walked through the campus, making sure to avoid the busy paths. dedicated scholars moved between buildings like shadows, carrying books and research materials, likely studying late.",1
"a minute or an hour later, Professor Thompson lifted a hand to signal the end of the experiment. the graduate assistants appeared quickly and gathered the test materials silently. they recorded their observations quietly and disappeared back to the lab.",1
the student looked like he couldn't believe he had just aced the most difficult exam in the course.,1
"he could not know how long he waited, clutching his notes, eager to present his dissertation successfully.",1
"Dr. Williams cursed himself for misjudging the equipment and wondered if it was the microscope or the centrifuge that was malfunctioning. either way, he preferred not to lose valuable research time.",1
"do not worry, I'm not disappointed, but your academic advisor will need to review this.",1
"Mia felt her mind turn into an ever tightening spiral, unsure of her professor's reaction. she might be impressed, possibly intrigued, and definitely eager for more data. the thought of her approval, and the knowledge that Mia had earned it, made her smile.",1
one of the students gasps and Amanda beams as she realizes she had grasped the complex formula.,1
it was so sudden when both teammates lunged for the ball and looked at each other with determination.,1
"when he was a teenager, he joined the youth soccer academy, Alex explained, crossing his arms as he watched the team practice from the sidelines.",1
"the players didn't look at the coach or at the spectators, but they moved in sync, and they were focused, and they listened to every direction.",1
"how could the thought of losing slice through her when she'd only just started playing professionally? and yet as she tried to imagine going back to a life without the sport, where ambition was unmet, she felt the need to give it everything.",1
"she couldn't call the trainer for a water break because she didn't know his schedule. she had to push through, keep playing; she couldn't quit now.",1
I paused and tried to hold back the tears of frustration. it happens every time I remember that my mistake cost the team the championship.,1
"Coach Simmons was at his motivational best, holding his hand out for Kelly to high five. Emily was watching Kelly's expression and caught a glimpse of determination before she nodded and accepted the encouragement.",1
"she is hopeful that, following a rigorous training session, she will be better able to achieve her personal best tomorrow.",1
"it was to keep the team from thinking about the past defeat, but it only made Olivia more resolved. Coach Jensen gave Olivia a pat on the back and sat down next to her. a teammate came over and began discussing strategy for the next match.",1
Marcus said they were both in the running for MVP anyway.,1
he tried to think what new markets salivated over innovative products before launching them. he hoped the gradual build-up of interest toward his startup idea was imperceptible to competitors.,1
"unfortunately, I was pretty sure the folks around here didn't understand the concept of venture capital. I was straightening my tie when the industry leader walked up, the other investors following in his wake.",1
Nick calmed a degree as he considered that and came to the conclusion that his business plan wasn't in immediate danger from fierce competition.,1
"Julie tried to catch it, but she was too slow to prevent the opportunity from slipping away.",1
"I had been enjoying the feel of the boardroom chair, something in great contrast to the nervous tension I felt inside before presenting my pitch. Confidence came over me as I realized my proposal was ready, then I refrained from overthinking.",1
"it was a long shot, but if no one had invested in those budding entrepreneurs, they would still be waiting.",1
"when he had seized the market opportunity to complete the test and notch a win for his startup, it had created a buzz among potential investors.",1
"he allowed his negative thoughts to overwhelm the good, forced his fears back down, and he strode forward with the same confidence he had gained the day he founded his company.",1
"if a person could not secure the required funding, the incubator offered them the chance to gain it through mentorship. often, such mentorship required nothing more than assisting in brainstorming sessions or minor project support.",1
"Meredith rolled off the couch and walked to her whiteboard, looking at her business strategy. for a moment, she had almost forgotten that the day was a vital turning point.",1
"I looked down at myself, seeing that the campaign suit had transformed my image, which was commanding now. I touched the badge on my chest, but then I chose to remove it.",1
"in the case of his advisors, his chief strategist had resigned and now his campaign manager was left disheartened and scrambling for a solution.",1
Montrose stood up from his seat and began pacing around the conference room.,1
"he takes a deep breath and responds seriously, yes, senator. Stanton calmly states, if this is a scandal, the investigation, which usually takes months, will be expedited in weeks.",1
she had consulted the renowned political analyst to foresee a way around this electoral crisis. the analyst had advised her to be authentic and everything would fall into place.,1
"if they remained allies for too long, they'd deplete each other's political capital. it was a safeguard the party used to prevent factional leaders from amassing too much power and disrupting unity.",1
"she dug around and pulled out a tailored blazer and a power skirt that would, with poise, perfectly suit her speech.",1
"he sat down on the edge, and reached cautiously for Korsten, as if seeking someone's permission to consult him.",1
"but the committee members were still debating over who would lead the initiative, and when she spoke, we couldn't hear her proposal.",1
"Kristiana, John, and Caspin had pulled chairs from the side and were now seated at the roundtable discussing strategy.",1
"Kosai ran ahead to the west gallery and cautiously skipped steps by two on his way down. he walked briskly toward the studio, but stopped and looked at the artist's offices.",1
his eyes were serious as he said you are forbidden to unveil the sculpture unless it's perfect.,1
"I told you, the painting isn't under review, the curator responded sharply.",1
"what if that critique or bad review comes back tomorrow? we're going to come up with a plan to address that, Damien told him.",1
"I had a sketch artist follow and report back to me and now my masterpiece is complete but so are the initial drafts, my apprentice was able to refine one of them before he left.",1
what makes you think it's a good idea to criticize me now? you think there is anything stopping me from painting over this?,1
"it hindered her creative flow and for every time her heart raced, more ideas flowed. the inspiration began to surface but it burned deeply as if she had poured passion into it.",1
she scrutinized the intricate brushstrokes layered on the canvas.,1
"frustration was eating at him, but he once again thumbed through the sketches he'd brought with him.",1
"he straightened from the easel, stiffened, but he didn't try to prolong the separation from his work-in-progress.",1
"Danven spoke in hushed tones to the band members, keeping his elaborate gestures to a minimum.",1
"before i could send them to perform for strangers, could i trust them to perform for those they called friends? although i would never intentionally throw oraden or tahir into unnecessary stress, on this i agreed with alexander. we had to know if they were ready, demetrius said.",1
how can you be sure the others you brought to the studio will remain committed?,1
he did not want her waking while he composed and he was much in need of inspiration.,1
"charles was next and, though he tried to be faster than daniel, he missed nearly half of the notes; then it was eleanor's turn.",1
"i asked mormo, as anyone would, what kind of instruments they played. she described that they had skills, that they wore headphones, and that they reminded her of what she had heard the maestros describe.",1
turson decided that it was time to improvise the unexpected.,1
"in this position, all he could think of was pulling her playlist across him and making use of her song selection for something much more emotional.",1
"when a seasoned producer makes a prediction like that, only a fool doesn’t take note.",1
"i almost didn't catch it because we didn't rehearse, but at the last minute, i realized what he wanted to happen and i hit the high note. my heart raced, and i was thankful for the applause the audience brought that covered up my unease.",1
"it may be a good idea to wear a reflective vest or something as well, Natasha whispers cautiously.",1
"by 1996, Alex was deeply involved in the community and he had gladly given up the idea of solitary success and instead went for fulfillment in community service and leadership. he managed to secure his dream role: chairperson for one of the top local non-profits.",1
"so he was basically volunteering his whole life right? yeah, pretty much and he was committed to it, so by the time he was eight he had organized a few events and was getting recognition just because it was good for the neighborhood.",1
"we must act quickly, he tried to keep his voice low and calm. even as he was making his plea, he could hear a gathering in the distance, closer, and coming from the community center.",1
"he turns to leave, but I bring him back across the room and encourage him to join the community discussion. it energizes him and he participates actively.",1
"he nodded, proud that his ability to improve his community was recognized.",1
"on the road, Greybeard entertained Andrew with colorful tales of his many community service projects and exploits.",1
"I borrowed some tools from Kali, he replied curtly and turned his attention back to the community garden.",1
"a woman gasped in surprise as they paraded north, around the bend near the community park, with a fast stride. she ran back inside her house, and Castellan couldn't help but grin. he could only hope they had the same effect on Cassius and the other community council members.",1
he then walked to the community center's kitchen and grabbed a jar of jelly and applied it to the other slice of bread for the community lunch.,1
"he's none too worried about the failed experiments he abandoned, my team and the project, and half the journal's lost credibility must come from his endless fabrications.",1
the scientist knew much too much about him for comfort.,1
"the media was saying that we were conducting dubious experiments in those labs, and creating dangerous chemicals with basic reagents.",1
"he looks my way and I give him the slightest, thankful smile. Gilbert doesn't say anything else as we wait a few more minutes for Walter to return with a couple of new researchers beside him.",1
"as we conducted the experiment, I immediately picked up on something peculiar. Dorian was a terrible researcher - too terrible to be real. he was obviously faking it, but his colleagues could not bring themselves to outshine their lead scientist.",1
you must release my research paper and its data and provide us with a new grant. this must be done in exactly the way I shall instruct you if you are ever to see publication again.,1
"a scientist has to leave his old hypotheses behind, like a theory you don't need in a new study. what they really mean when they ask you to hypothesize with an open mind is to leave biases minus the ego.",1
Thomas grabbed his lab notes off the desk before his colleague asked for his input.,1
"I remember all too well what it was like for me in those nerve-wracking days after my study was rejected. I stop that avenue of thought and pull the flashlight from my bag, turning it on as we reach the dark part of the lab.",1
"after the lab accident the day before, I was afraid to continue the experiment. for the first time in my career, I actually considered halting the research and seeking another focus.",1
"we will respect your coding standards and your intellectual property, Fanchon said.",1
"she handed him the prototype and left after another explanation. the engineer held the device in his hand, looking at it curiously for a moment, then, opening the panel, brought it to his ear, giving it a good listen.",1
"Tristan sent another software update that crashed Vyan's system. Evalle rushed forward and stepped in front of Vyan, blocking Tristan's next virus with a firewall.",1
"downing the balance of her coffee, she considered her next debug solution. finding the root cause was going to take some time since the logs hadn't shown any errors. she doubted the bug was still in that module and had no idea how to trace it again.",1
"you had no problem with me fixing your code last night. now get a grip on my algorithm, she says, and run your tests.",1
"then he simply crashed, screen staring blankly, and processed no more.",1
"maybe Reece had some misguided fantasy that Ridley was going to become a tech guru like her, now that she was certified.",1
"i moved through the servers, slowly working my way from issue to issue. they were not a system that had long uptimes, as a whole.",1
"but Cassie knew to ignore it, and she also understood that, for Adam's sake, she had to appear confident they were doing the right thing by integrating Scarlett's code back into the main branch.",1
he sighed in relief when I assured him I would be on call for the evening.,1
"we will chat later, but now I am exhausted and wish to log off for the night.",1
"everything he had posted to expose the influencer who was manipulating their followers had worked as much in their favor as his own, but none of them knew what had transpired.",1
we made a check of the trending posts on the platform; the hashtag was the principal topic for the community and therefore garnering a lot of attention.,1
"then the silence was broken as notifications chimed and comments started pouring in. a few of the admins had their fingers poised over their keyboards, as if trying to hold themselves back. they wanted to reply, but they were fighting the urge.",1
"a couple of the female moderators had the same trouble that the men had, just as at least one of the men had had no problem not silencing trolls.",1
"but she found the rest of the world didn’t share her interest in promoting creative underrepresented voices. followers had dropped and the page was close to being inactive. so, in desperation, she had recently resorted to also featuring viral internet challenges to gain exposure.",1
"he inspected the comments for a moment before grunting in satisfaction. he turned and disappeared around a series of posts that filled the feed, and reappeared moments later with a link he sent to Michael.",1
"he knew what she was typing, knew that she couldn't bear to read the rest of what he had posted because she wasn't yet sure how to respond. or maybe she already knew but simply didn't want to tweet it right now.",1
"he had decided to start creating a montage in the gallery section out of trending memes, making a little project out of getting engagement.",1
"Simon had expected Jace to argue with him on this, to comment back, not to just log off.",1
no one spoke during the meeting and hardly any notes were taken. a tension filled the room and the knowledge that this was their last chance to present grieved all present.,1
"he allowed her a small project each week to maintain her skills, but she wasn't allowed any challenging, high-profile tasks. just some basic duties-mostly filing and organizing documents while seated at her desk.",1
"the assistant perked up, abashed; the two colleagues muttered excuses, which Junichiro evidently cut short; he motioned them out of the office and stepping in, took their place, his expression hard and focused.",1
Leo leaned over the desk and took her pen in his hand.,1
and he was at the moment speaking to someone on his office phone.,1
"the next morning at the break of dawn, everybody sneaked in and went to the conference room.",1
"Stokes added, sir, during the project review, we lost lead developer Rodriguez and your two analysts in Group A. the two QA testers are all right with a few critiques, but we got it done, sir. my team, the developers, and all the managers really pushed through those last reports.",1
she found the rhythm of the conversation and decided she just needed to enjoy the networking event.,1
it made Ryan happy to know Sal approved of Natalie joining the team.,1
"a CEO must have full or partial support of the board according to company law. deep in Aten's mind, he wishes there was a different corporate structure. the CEO knows the company's future rests on his shoulders, and his reputation is on the line.",1
"as such, you should have alerted the committee to the scheduling conflict.",1
"once he got a sip or two of the coffee from the faculty lounge in him, though, it was difficult to get him to stop talking.",1
I held the slides in place and she activated the microscope.,1
he coughed with a dry throat and winced with the effort of it. finally he relaxed his strained expression and explained again.,1
"he turned around to face Dr. Whisper, who was standing back with her arms crossed, waiting.",1
"I knew enough about academia to know that if I reported plagiarism, it would not be taken seriously. my concerns rarely seemed to be taken seriously anyway.",1
"you can submit the dissertation whenever it's convenient for you. he said as he laid back in his chair. he trusted Dr. Randi, but he wanted to verify that the revisions were accepted first.",1
"taking the final exam without studying was something we'd discussed the first morning we realized the professor rarely checked notes, but neither of us turned out to be that reckless.",1
"yes, he understood that it was in everyone's best interest for Dr. Blackbourne to believe there was no chance of collaboration between him and Professor Sabelle. but the persistent rumors still made him eager to prove to everyone else that Sabelle was, and would always be, his research partner.",1
"he laughed at her sarcasm, then his eyes turned serious while he slid his hand down to the stack of papers, to her research notes.",1
"if he has done anything unexpected on the field, please remember that he only has the purest intentions and I apologize on his behalf.",1
"but the coach refused to speak, though they gathered around him and begged him to say who had given him the strategy. at first they promised him all sorts of rewards, and later they threatened to exclude him from the game.",1
"he may in fact have fouled, Mateo said, but we will establish that through the proper review channels.",1
"he plants one end of the pole in the ground and vaults himself, feet-first, over the high bar. he screams in joy as the soles of his shoes clear the bar, and I'm sent cheering with excitement.",1
"Genghis knew he should not see the replay, but he watched anyway until the disappointment dried up.",1
she looked up at me for a second and opened her mouth. a bubble of excitement burst out and spilled down over her words.,1
"the coach turned, giving Bethel a none-too-gentle pat. stumbling a little, he accompanied Lodestok back to the coach's bench. Lodestok strode over to a chair and threw himself into it as he usually did.",1
"he was looking at me the same way he had when he sat down next to me after the tough loss, even though the section was all roped off and only the team was supposed to sit there.",1
"he must see the determination on my face, because he smiles and pats Bernie Kosar's back.",1
"they locked and secured their lockers, they spoke to only their teammates and those they could trust and, when the training sessions were canceled, they practiced at home in the evenings.",1
"I couldn't launch the product just yet - not until I'd ensured the marketing team was ready, and my investors were confident.",1
Beth called the ever-ready Sanjeev and instructed him to be prepared for another pitch tonight.,1
"she read about strategies the industry leaders had already shared: that for decades they and their teams influenced markets, built companies, disrupted industries, and created innovations.",1
"he called or emailed daily to check on their progress. whether they were swamped with work or not, it didn't stop him from encouraging his team, and they definitely tried to meet his expectations.",1
"when she laughed softly during the meeting, this time it didn't end with her feeling stressed.",1
"when she was younger, her mother had diligently taken her to coding classes and business fairs, and she never lost the entrepreneurial spirit. when she was nine, Zanas had begged and begged to attend the startup incubator in the big city.",1
"no one made demands of the venture capitalists unless they had a solid plan so this one must be strategic indeed. she heard determination in his voice, a determination that was barely restrained. please vision, give him the breakthrough he needs to lead us, she prayed.",1
Uncle Macon cleared his throat and adjusted a button on his crisp business suit.,1
"many people he'd met in the past months said he had a vision identical to Ashton's, except for the slight differences in execution. refusing to linger any longer, or bother to listen to the naysayers, Ragnar walked confidently away.",1
"I start to turn my attention back to the team, but a man with long brown hair and a confident demeanor approaches from the corner, waving his hand at me.",1
"I had a theory that because they were not so consciously aware of their own influence, they could be strategic and decisive.",1
"I knew a few things nobody else did, that's all. I knew because I got the chance to discuss it with Senator Felton minutes before he was indicted.",1
"he would have played the influence card years earlier, but of course he'd needed to wait until his ally had climbed the political ladder far enough to steer the campaign his way.",1
Bowie steeled himself for the possibility that he might have to take over the campaign at some point.,1
"it was just his fear of defeat that compelled him to act such, or so he told himself as they drove off.",1
"for ten years I debated against seasoned politicians, every day. I outwitted them in arguments, to debate one opponent is a luxury, it becomes so easy.",1
"Bailey figured it out a few months ago, Eugene whispered, leaning in.",1
"Kiara wished she could think of some way to keep his support, but his backup left her longing. with swift movements, he passed her the campaign flyer and departed.",1
"as she lay in her bed, staring up through the darkness at the prospects of her political career, she decided that tomorrow was the day she would finally make her move.",1
"she walked straight to the podium, and took it to address the assembly.",1
Roth laughed as he slipped the sketch back in his portfolio.,1
he patted her and then came to sit with the other painters.,1
"I know Tom, which is why it is you who must choose. it is given to you to make the choice of displaying the piece or not.",1
you and Broderic must take the sculpture with you and present it at the exhibition.,1
I was there to get Ambrose back to that great creative space of his. my mind accepted that readily and I once again had the inspiration to continue.,1
"he leaned in again, his brush gently touching the edge of my canvas.",1
"if you should feel uninspired or stuck, immerse yourself in art and this will give your mind a burst of creativity.",1
"as soon as she realized what she was painting, she snapped her eyes back up to the model and saw the faintest smirk on his face. Harlow cleared her throat, the most awkward blush creeping onto her cheeks, and started adjusting things on her palette.",1
"he decided to critique, so I had to defend my work. but critiques do not always end well.",1
"the critic stared at her for a moment, eyes wide, his face already intrigued.",1
"if he pulled through this performance, his schedule was going to be a little lighter for a while.",1
he and his bandmates had come over here to jam.,1
"the tour had no end in sight, and it would do me some good to perform, as the promoter had suggested, for a larger audience.",1
the fans know this and will leave us be until the encore.,1
"I know you can harmonize better than anyone else, girlfriend.",1
"Jill was fast asleep, which I took as a small mercy. I wouldn't have to face her judgmental look or figure out how to break the silence.",1
"for a moment she wondered if her fans were still waiting for her. when her frustration subsided, she rejoined the band in the recording studio.",1
he stood with his guitar strapped and his fingers poised over the strings. the little drummer feigned a beat to his right and nab spun and hit him hard with a riff.,1
"musicians also had to agree to share the spotlight without jealousy. band members would address the lead singer as the frontman, not to signify a leader relationship, but as a sign of respect.",1
"she lets out her breath and lies against the studio couch, staring up at the dim studio lights.",1
the words rumbled around her tired and responsibility-clouded mind. she kept waiting for the committee's ideas to make some sort of sense to her. she shook her head as the situation was just too complex to really be happening.,1
"yeah, that might have been a little bit of a stretch, but I was going with it. I took a trembling breath, trying to calm my nerves before making my speech.",1
this is good because it ensured that the Community Clean-up Day would have sufficient volunteers.,1
the power to help and uplift people and events was like a passion to him.,1
they reached the end of the community hall and made a right where the meeting rooms sat nestled in the corner.,1
"we sipped coffee together, and her eyes became more lively as the caffeine kicked in.",1
"ashamed of my nervous actions, I close my eyes, wanting to leave the meeting. maybe Kimberly's right, and I feel anxious at the thought.",1
"they were milling about, worried and unsure, and, like concerned citizens everywhere, when they were worried and unsure they got agitated.",1
"I think that there are others like us who are tired of the association's inaction and constant delays, but without someone else to lead, they are attending the meeting because they know they have no other options.",1
"much to his surprise, Darren eventually stopped complaining, and appeared to remain calm. shaken by the close call, Laverick stood in place for a short duration as a bead of sweat ran down his face.",1
"when she looked back, Devontay was rifling through the lab drawers, emerging with a beaker in his hands before closing the cabinet shut.",1
"yes, research can frustrate, complicate, and challenge; but it can also enlighten, discover, and advance. it can open one's eyes to new phenomena, or it can bewilder them completely.",1
"he said goodbye to Amy, then stepped up to the microscope. the man in the white lab coat gave him an automatic nod.",1
"it made sense to him, but he never confirmed it. he hated running experiments to make sure his hypothesis was correct.",1
"I spotted an opportunity and did one of those quick data-collection maneuvers from one variable to another, no hesitation, and then sped up and looped back over two conditions.",1
"she steps into the dark, silent lab, ready to share her solitude. Dot is so lost in her research that she doesn't even look up when Lucy walks in. she simply stares down at the data she clearly isn't even analyzing.",1
he remembered one of the reasons why he and Malou had never completed that final experiment.,1
Riyan moved closer to see what discovery may be inside.,1
"just as the second researcher reached the end of the lab bench, Matthew heaved the sample over the divider.",1
"he'd gone on and on about how we should just let her finish her analysis, but I knew the truth. he was afraid that if she knew I was switching projects, she'd try to intervene.",1
he handed her device back and as he padded from the office she heard him whisper back thanking her for putting the files back in their place.,1
"reining in his own ambitions had been the most difficult challenge of his career, but he'd done it.",1
Mary rejoins them and resumes her position next to David on the development team's central workspace.,1
"she'd lost her patience once before-once, when her first manager chose the wrong moment to push her too hard. she still remembered the feeling of smashing the laptop, and the shock on everyone's faces.",1
some engineers cautiously agreed with Orrick's design while others strongly refuted it.,1
it was the term that some of my colleagues had used for him. I didn't know what to say because I hadn't done enough to deserve the title.,1
"some of them sit down on office chairs, eating their snacks, while others walk and chat by us, networking.",1
he scribbled it onto a sticky note one of those that were usually for reminders and flicked it over to me when he was done. it hit me in the shoulder and fell spiraling down to the desk.,1
"still, I liked the thought of making the competitor sweat a little. and I certainly wasn't in a hurry to get there, anyway. I finished my coding session, then pushed away from the desk.",1
"later, I launched the app successfully, and he faced bugs.",1
"I will have you start managing the trending hashtag first, he said, pointing her to the dashboard.",1
"if you want his followers, you'll have to come through me, she declared.",1
"I fought to regain control of my account as he spammed through my post's comments. I was sure that his profile was actually trolling angrily, all traces of the support I knew gone.",1
but my tweet started gaining negative traction and he made me delete it.,1
"a short time later, Thomas pushed through the chatroom with a meme that he had obviously taken from Alanna's post.",1
"without a word of protest, she slumped on top of the keyboard and was offline within seconds. leaving the chat open, I turned off all notifications and returned to my timeline.",1
Henry was in command when they were raiding the rival influencer's page.,1
"they wanted to get as close to the target audience as possible using the ad campaign, to minimize irrelevant clicks.",1
"the old man with the white mustache was mumbling, shaking his head at his grandson, who looked rather unhappy now with the unfollowers as well.",1
"Bauman stuffed the selfie stick into his backpack and returned to the live stream platform. Rick moved to the next comment section and Bauman sat, pushing away the thin strands of tousled hair that had fallen across his brow.",1
"the office around the building was fairly calm and Stephanie selected a project for them. they returned to the conference room and she pulled out some charts, and through sheer force of bubbly personality managed to get Nora and Maryann engaged in the presentation.",1
"I probably met half the company, with the exception of anyone in my department. and in a workplace like ours where most of the employees come into the break room, one can safely expect the gossip to be rampant.",1
"he moved to the door, threw back the dead bolts, and didn't look at Jazz directly during the meeting.",1
"I sat at my desk staring at my inbox that contained Isaac's email, which I had never responded to. I thought about replying a hundred times, but all I had were a bunch of lame excuses I knew anyone would see right through.",1
"she used to say that she and her colleague Lucy were office changelings because nobody else in her team touched office supplies unless they had to, but she and Lucy had to be organized like little perfectionists all the time.",1
I worked closely with him and learned much of his management style.,1
"I let him help me organize the middle of the desk, though I didn't need the help.",1
"he tried to make it a joke, but his eyes gave away his stress.",1
"thinking back, I truly regretted the way I handled the project and if I could, I would go back in time and change my approach.",1
"he complimented her, but she stepped out of the conversation.",1
"if he was to face an academic challenge, he had to buy time, at least until his colleagues arrived.",1
"I buried my face in the comforting scent of textbooks, and hid against the library shelves.",1
"Fats had still not responded, and Andrew had not seen him all morning, because they shared none of their seminars. he had not seen Fats for the previous two weekends either, because he had been working on his thesis at the lab.",1
"Brody requested that she kept to the plain concepts because of his lack of knowledge in the complex research fields. it was simply explained that Kate had created a private scholarship in both of their names, and named it the Rose Scholarship, in honor of Brody's charitable mother.",1
it was hard to convince people that research discoveries happened outside of what they knew.,1
my fist hit Raz's argument and then went through it with counter-evidence.,1
"he shook his head, expression so clearly filled with regret it was as if he was a different professor from the one who had given her a failing grade.",1
Charles began to forget the disappointing results he had just witnessed and started to smile for Alice's academic success. the uncertainty of her research was gone and she would always have the determination to succeed now. Charles felt like he had made his breakthrough.,1
"his left hand moved lightly up the curve of her transcript, and in the morning light she saw a fine lacework of notes around his eyes when he smiled at her.",1
he was pale and did not appear to be focused during the lecture.,1
"the bulging-eyed coach hurried to help the athlete off the field - and then another athlete, following after her.",1
"I patted the bench and she jumped up beside me, all the while watching Lucius warily. I passed her the water bottle, and that seemed to be enough for her because she relaxed.",1
"Vasquez will go back and tell him that we, specifically Tony Russo, didn’t ask him a single question about the play.",1
"he went away for seven months of intense training, and by her coach’s calculations, he should have already been back.",1
"I had to fight to remain upright, and clutched desperately at Devyn's arm to stay balanced during the game.",1
the team captain scribbled her plan on a notepad and told his teammates to check the locker room to see if there actually was a missing jersey.,1
"a defender turned to face him, lifting his racket to cover his face and thrusting blindly. Manea brushed aside the racket and swung an overhand smash, sending the ball across the net.",1
"before that he had managed, though half injured, to complete three amazing marathons.",1
Aunt Tabby was holding our tickets and she looked really irritated.,1
Jane looked up at Macklin with that determination in her eyes that he remembered and was drawn to.,1
I started living and breathing for the thrill of a successful pitch.,1
"we would take our chances with different marketing strategies and test the campaign in several places along the way. as a last resort, if none of this worked, we would go back to the drawing board the way we came. at this point one way seemed just as risky as the next.",1
he looked toward the front lines where his team still held their resolve.,1
we go together to raise funding for the might of our startup.,1
I didn't hear the whole business plan until much later that evening.,1
"he quickly sat down again and asked his next question, barely giving the investors time to ponder or disagree.",1
"in all the years I'd worked with him, I'd never seen him this excited, and I wasn't entirely sure whether to be inspired or cautious.",1
"I prodded my brain with relentless questions until it figured out my next move. my brain pointed out that I knew the current industry mentor of the accelerator program, and that the guy owed me some fairly big favors.",1
"Charles tried to keep his composure and not let panic take him; after he took his first step in launching the product, he felt overwhelmed.",1
"Morlin smiled as he pitched, and Castellan felt warmth spread into his chest as if the presentation was directed only to him.",1
Allan lowered the petition into the committee to present it. it took him some effort to pull the needed signatures once it was reviewed.,1
"what are you doing in this debate, you are obviously not constituents? my name is Benedikte Loevaas, she said evenly and with a touch of defiance.",1
"if he is still campaigning, we'll rescue him from the smear tactics and return him to the platform.",1
Gus raised his hand signaling Matthew that he had the right of way in the discussion and sat back in his chair and listened.,1
"Barachiel defeated the first opposition candidate in a debate, and I countered another-well, nearly, anyway. I opened the floor for Twila, so I was an accomplice for sure.",1
the spokesperson halted for a moment and pulled back his notes.,1
"the aide turned back to Ki, looping an arm under her shoulder and pulling her to her podium.",1
"he examined the proposal, and then dropped it into the legislative session.",1
"in the meantime, the purchasers of the political ads between Main Street and Central Avenue had started their respective campaigns in 1974-1975.",1
she didn't really realize the enormity of the policy decision at hand.,1
"when I got to the bottom of the staircase, there was a line of artists waiting to pass by the gallery curator and the velvet rope that he controlled.",1
"they had been talking, quite seriously, about moving to Paris, where Ruth's sister and brother-in-law lived.",1
"she took him inside the studio so that she could teach him to paint, one of her favorite forms of expression.",1
"he plunged forward, creating now out of fear of what would happen if he stopped.",1
"Amira was only a few strokes away from finishing, but her vision blurred and her pulse raced.",1
"she gripped the brush, determined to leave one last masterpiece for Storm to have when she left.",1
"Kelly tugged her long brown hair out of its bun and shook it out. I haven’t seen or heard from her in, wow, must be over two years now.",1
"as he started up them, he looked back and saw Hamish reaching for the sketchbook and Eloise opening the canvas-covered easel.",1
"the sculptors looked at one another and then, as one, took a step towards the workshop door.",1
"I haven’t received official word yet, but I’m pretty sure my exhibit is postponed until further notice. get a portfolio packed, and be ready when I get there.",1
"she leaned forward, still holding the sheet music close at neck and chest.",1
"unfortunately, booking more gigs and overspending on tours was not an answer to the largest financial challenge that the band had ever faced.",1
"I had never been nervous around an audience before, but this one was different and I actually felt like a tongue-tied fool in their presence. the night we had our first concert, she was late, and I'd been terrified that she'd decided not to come.",1
"she'd gotten herself through music school with it, crammed it in a small practice room with three other musicians.",1
"he didn’t hit any wrong notes, but the intensity got the band’s full attention. releasing his own riff, Cage jumped back and stayed low to the ground while holding himself up on the amp. Rhody quickly found his rhythm and played fiercely at Cage, but didn’t challenge him again.",1
when I came into the music scene there were no problems to be worked out. the gigs were great and there was no reason to question my path.,1
most of all she'd been angry at herself for not being able to come up with a melody that would help.,1
I drove along until I found the most acoustic-friendly area I could find and took a deep breath and started playing. miraculously the chords flowed smoothly and I made it all the way to the end.,1
"the second part of the review concerned a track that had been found buried near the end of the album. a piece of something special had been found in the track, in the chorus from what Nero could understand. it was only a written review with no audio samples attached.",1
"he tugs his fingers through his hair and yanks on the roots as his head falls forward, trying to find inspiration for the next verse.",1
"someone must have trained him, because in a too-smooth movement he collected her flyers, bundling them so efficiently it brought her campaign efforts to a halt.",1
"he heard muted laughter and a young female voice hushing the neighbors, and his curiosity got the best of him.",1
"the car streaked past the community garden, and she adjusted her route again, putting the meandering pedestrians between her and the first protest group.",1
the man hit the ground at a jog and was on his feet not far from them. he looked at James and then back at the rapidly approaching committee members.,1
he waved half his volunteers toward the back of the hall to block off the only other entrance.,1
"he approached her slowly and placed his hands on her shoulders, showing support for her community project.",1
"she really wants me in a coordinating outfit and to host a community gathering I guess. the event was still two months away, but when both sides of your neighborhood are active participants, you kind of have to plan things out a little early.",1
"she lifted her apron over her head and let it fall to the ground, ready to join the cleanup.",1
I was glad for the topic change but not so happy about where it went.,1
"Kody raised her hands and formed a shadowy box between them. because of her organizational skills, he knew she was preparing to show him community project plans. but where he used his for events, she was focusing on the past year's achievements.",1
those words brought a spark to his eyes as they reminded him of so many hypotheses that had been validated. how many researchers and scholars had come to him and then praised his groundbreaking work after he'd presented his findings?,1
I shook off Dale's suggestion and took a step toward Evan.,1
"without taking his eyes off the data, he extended an arm and the report hung from his fingertips.",1
"I dozed off one night in 1983, listening to a lecture. when I fell asleep, I was listening to a piece on sustainable energy; when I woke up, they were talking about genetic engineering.",1
"he pushed to his feet and gave my notebook a playful tug. that's why I'm going to go to the lab and double-check my results, even though Aislin and I aren't really co-authors.",1
"she paused as if waiting for him to challenge her hypothesis. Patrick recalled Rousseau’s and Filippi’s warnings, but his instincts told him that he would get nowhere with the professor by stonewalling her.",1
"the assistant didn't reply, and Keirran finally bent down, putting my notes around his shoulders.",1
"you may be intentionally misinterpreting your experiment which makes you a liability to this research team, Morgan said in a chilling tone.",1
Jolon felt like he was on the verge of a breakthrough and it took a huge effort to get one foot in front of the other without stumbling.,1
"he marked her lab notebook with his notes, and let her mark his with hers.",1
"this was the belief of those depicted in the developer community and it was the same belief Eli was charged to uphold as lead engineer. he let out a satisfied sigh, which was stopped short when he turned to see two hackers approaching.",1
"after a few minutes he gave up and went to his workstation. he would have to consider long and hard over the events of this deployment, and he thought he could do it better there than at his headquarters.",1
check on my junior developer and be sure he's in bed and not downtown debugging code. he eased the door open to the developer's room far enough to see that he was sleeping soundly and hopefully stress-free.,1
"I control my frustration as I grab a keyboard, close my eyes, and ask, how do you expect to regain your focus if you don't take breaks?",1
"he staggered back, hit the server rack behind him and rebounded. she sidestepped, added momentum with a straight arm across his shoulder blades, and he sprawled facedown across the desk.",1
my users love it and it's our most popular app.,1
"upon seeing me she rushed to us without hesitation, with the most worried look on her face.",1
Tom couldn't code and he wasn't certain that he really wanted to.,1
his left hand was in a brace and I could see the outline of bandages beneath his shirt. a faint grin tugged at my lips when I observed the stylus clamped firmly at the corner of his mouth. he looked tired but otherwise seemed to be his usual self.,1
"why did he have to watch her apply for a project lead role, anyway?",1
it forced him to slam on the brakes and put the post into a quick edit to avoid the flagged comment. Brooks was monitoring a heated debate in the thread and intervening with his moderator privileges.,1
"with a grin, Sarssen crossed his legs and stretched out with a yawn, scrolling through his feed.",1
he chuckled with pride when I described how I had made the first viral post.,1
"at any other time he would have asked them to pause the live stream so that they could chat offline for a while. when he turned to the side, he was surprised to discover that Rowan had been watching him.",1
"she frowned as she scrolled through that profile that was curated to perfection up to those clear, breathtaking photos. no one would ever guess Xypher was anything other than authentic, yet she knew better.",1
"Rae retweeted, but then tried a more conciliatory comment.",1
"as I took this journey and drafted my posts into intricate captions, Mery-Et suffered the most even as she gave me her full support.",1
"she wanted to put herself in the spotlight, wanted to jump into the trending conversation, and he’d forbidden it as well.",1
I had no reason to think that boosting this post was a waste of time.,1
"stepping back, I pulled my hoodie up, and the black fabric helped camouflage me. my profile was already liberally filled with content, so I went with it, updating every inch with new posts. Chance did the same, and then we slid away into the feed.",1
"her eyes were calm as she looked back at him. she wanted to assist him, but she couldn’t say that so she instead took a more logical explanation. i need a focal point and you are the lead on this project.",1
"the two sit around and drink coffee, saying little to each other. Laptos breaks the silence by asking, when will you return? if all goes well, i will come back in two months, Daygun replies.",1
it sometimes annoyed Catalina that everything about Phillip's outer appearance conveyed professionalism. she wondered what he would do if she walked over to him and tilted his computer monitor.,1
"his nerves tightened, holding his next breath while he waited to see what she'd do next in the meeting.",1
"yes, they had chatted frequently, but rarely about the important projects.",1
the first troubling reminder of her initial anxiety came about a week later when they were going to the client pitch.,1
he ended up constantly taking on more projects for the thrill. he had to keep raising the bar in the end because the excitement wore off and he crashed into burnout.,1
"i walked over to the reports with heavy, reluctant feet.",1
"i wanted a promotion and i required two team leads. i reckoned that was the minimum we'd need on a thirty-six month contract—one for myself, and one for Mairi managing the operations team.",1
"i press down harder, finally feeling his stress start to ease in response to my reassurance.",1
"so they bought a run-down research lab, redesigned the interior, decided on a name and opened for students.",1
"Dan fell on the ground and let her climb over him as she raked him with her pointed critiques and bit him with her sharp, detailed feedback. they went to the main library and Dan carried Alexandra through most of it.",1
Clarissa flipped her brunette wavy hair over her right shoulder and dropped her over-loaded gray backpack onto the classroom desk.,1
"Mike lowered his highlighter and crowded into the study booth, Karen rushing up behind him. the couple stared down at the complex diagram as Elvi did, then peered at each other, then back to the diagram, then to their notes.",1
"my head spun with the enormity of it all: a single discovery, distant by a century, was still affecting thousands, perhaps millions of academic theories today.",1
"for the last three years they studied with Professor Herod. the wise and respected professor valued sound advice from learned students. now that Herod is retired, his mentees are fighting over their research topics.",1
we've all certainly been on edge these last few days before the submission deadline.,1
Marissa progresses quickly through the campus doing a quick survey of the informational booths displayed.,1
"I wanted to discuss with Professor Manco, who knows everything about Mayan history, but Alura warned me not to contact anyone from my past research groups. I couldn’t take the chance of putting Manco or his colleagues in jeopardy under any circumstances.",1
"I expected to see Daemon, but they had gotten to him earlier. I hated not knowing what was going on with his research.",1
he shoved the gear into place with a gleam in his eye that said he was barely one half-step from scoring a winning goal.,1
"when the coach returned home, he finally got what he considered to be very good news.",1
"then she ran to the locker room, seized the telephone and called the trainer, but the line was busy.",1
"it dawned on me around halftime that I hadn't seen or heard from Al since the last game, and I felt an immense guilt; which I managed to suppress with thoughts of how if anything had happened to him, I would have heard.",1
"he kept up the thing with his hands, repeatedly coming dangerously close to the ball. after a while, my legs tingled, kind of like when our shoes had touched before, but not as overwhelming. when I finally reopened my eyes, Hayden had this serious look on his face.",1
"it was the coach that had brought her here. she had a vague recollection of Randwulf calling him Leofric. as she watched he grasped the towel that Eda had left floating in the ice water, wrung it out, and placed it against Finan's feverish face.",1
"this meant he would have to leave a perfectly good racecar behind, which he considered terribly wasteful. he even went to the trouble of reinforcing it to withstand the heavy load.",1
"she relied on the boy's muscle memory to take her higher until she was on the diving board that stretched toward the pool and the open water. she climbed out toward the edge of the board, and just as she reached toward the water, the board began to wobble.",1
"in one powerful tackle I knocked Alastair on his back. you could've been a little quicker on the defense, I said in a quiet voice as his teammates surrounded him and helped him to his feet. their bewildered looks made me want to knock all of them down.",1
"though that wasn't the same thing as telling me he'd make the play, I made myself smile at him as we went back inside. he resumed his position as Roy returned to the field.",1
"but you and I still have some pitches to perfect here. and though she would never admit it, Tina thought James made a fair argument for putting away the business plan for good.",1
"take anything you need, our resources are at your disposal.",1
my smirk vanishes as Neal continues to scrutinize me.,1
"by 8:30am, his documents had dried out completely and he focused on his responsibilities for the startup.",1
"obviously, no one had ever challenged him, and he didn't know what to make of me—a genuine threat or a potential collaborator.",1
"during the conference, I sat in the panelists' row, but it took a while for me to feel like a real entrepreneur.",1
"he crossed to a recycling bin, throwing the empty package boxes away. from that distance, he turned and tossed something to her.",1
"the investor looked surprised, but evidently decided not to go into it.",1
"no one said a word, but he had a feeling that the competitive colleague was about to get a serious reprimand.",1
we trade some ideas with the international partners every six months.,1
"she stared out the office window for a long time, remembering her early days in the campaign, which she hadn't thought about since she first entered politics.",1
"I know you are the one who leaked the report. that I am, Cada Varl replied flatly, showing no regret or pride in his voice.",1
"the truth was that Aidan hadn't been afraid of the policy debate, or the heated arguments. but he was afraid of whatever influence Itzy was wielding over the voters, without her even being aware of it.",1
"Katricia straightened and moved aside as he approached, giving him space, and he felt relief slide through him.",1
"like the knowledge of how to debate, he somehow understood that a politician usually had to work hard at public speaking to have such an influential presence.",1
"Rob Sardan is going to be a legend, but the road to statesmanship is paved with temptation and deceit.",1
it was only when I got the documents back to the office that I looked at the piece of paper Spartan had given me.,1
Victor answered DJ's hushed question with a shake of the head.,1
I need her by my side when the vote comes.,1
"Karen stood upright, kept moving forward, and got so close to Lea, that only the most compact arguments could be exchanged.",1
"she took a step into the gallery, and I nodded. she continued, walking before my easel, her pudgy hands by her sides. keeping the painting materials at arm's length, I glanced over my shoulder.",1
"she felt she could stare at the sculpture for hours on end, and when she had her new studio, she would probably do just that.",1
the three of them are under the impression that this art collective will not last as it is for long.,1
"she tried to recall her inspirations, assuming they must have caused the thumping heartbeat and clammy sweat that she could feel freezing on her forehead in the chilly studio.",1
"Brit walked over to me, wanting to know what to sketch next.",1
"'you had one sip of inspiration and started crying,' Denaos replied. 'perhaps you should preserve your dignity now and leave before you find another sip of creativity and add involuntary urination to the problem.' Dreadaeleon somehow managed to find a healthy medium between fury and astonishment at the insult.",1
"a moment later, all three removed their VR art headsets and turned to look at Steffor.",1
"his stomach still churned, but he felt the strong bond that he and Cody had formed. it gave Tom the strength to keep his composure. he wouldn’t want any other artist standing next to him during a critique.",1
"before I came here, I was very prejudiced toward modern art, but they are not like our art teachers taught us.",1
"it was a tricky question, but his voice sounded innocent, like he was just curious.",1
he pulled his microphone from his jacket and contacted the sound engineer.,1
"since his collaborator failed to make an appearance, Korsten walked toward the recording studio, hating the hollow sound of his lone footsteps upon the polished floor.",1
Misaki and Katie were lucky to find a table up close near the stage and quickly took a seat. the two girls ordered beers and sat back to kill time as they waited for the concert to start.,1
"you hear it all the time in the news, someone unexpectedly releasing a controversial track and causing an uproar.",1
"Jodi smiled and helped her daughter dry her tears and arrange her dress. if you consult records kept by the music academy, that is what you'll find. your dad beyond those records is a musician with no recorded albums or tours, he doesn't exist.",1
"I can take my time and make you savor every note, or I can do it quickly and be done with the performance once and for all.",1
"we wake up with the sun, and before eating or showering Katarina has me run vocal drills in the backyard: singing scales up and down, doing breath control exercises, and practicing harmonics.",1
"why be an office worker when I can jump onto stages and rock the crowds, Jill yelled. we are approaching showtime, so put your game faces on, the stage manager yelled.",1
"he was scratching at his ribs and still laughing. their host was standing over him, and the first thing she saw was that his hair—that baby-fine, shoulder-length white hair—was now almost entirely black. the lines around his eyes and mouth had been erased.",1
"the two of them ran from venue to venue, slid here and there, and jumped from stage to stage. only one member from the road crew could keep up with them.",1
she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the community center's window.,1
"Trent turned to the noise, his lips parting as he took a deep, resolute breath. funny, I'd have thought he'd look worried, not determined, and I stifled a surge of what might be a feeling of camaraderie.",1
"when my feet hit the pavement, I glanced down and frowned with distaste. I still wore the volunteer uniform; the flimsy thing hadn't magically disappeared.",1
all she could do was stare at Nykyrian as a neighbor moved forward to offer condolences.,1
"they have earned a reputation for disrupting meetings, not serving as organizers for them. gentlemen, let me assure you, the community working hand in hand with disruptors can bring no good to anyone.",1
"Amma rubbed my shoulders as she spoke, and I felt a shiver go down my spine.",1
"thank you, Ella smiled broadly and her heart seemed to breathe. she felt like hugging the woman, but offered a firm handshake instead.",1
I heave a great sigh as if it'll be my last chance to speak at the town hall.,1
I'm going to go ascertain how Tunstell is getting on with the neighborhood committee. then I think we might need to notify the city council.,1
"regardless of their origins, the community thrived in the urban areas until they crossed to the suburban neighborhoods in search of a better quality of life for themselves, and subsequently, a worse situation for those who currently resided there.",1
the general belief is that he concentrated so much on the experiment that it gave him some kind of mental exhaustion.,1
"he jumped off the lab stool and sat before the microscope, and the others joined him.",1
"all along, ever since the fateful night that I'd made the decision to pursue this research, I'd been doing what I swore I'd never do.",1
"anytime you wanted to hook someone on your scientific discovery, you gave them a glimpse of the data for free.",1
Unni lifted the heavy electron microscope out of its casing again and pulled as hard as she could.,1
"I yelled to Edmund, who had been sulking in the lab corner.",1
"pointing to two of his lab assistants, John said pick him up and sit him down. Judge looked squarely into the dazed scientist's eyes and said there will be no negotiation and you have one more opportunity to answer my question.",1
"we've had enough of the principal investigator who's hell-bent on disregarding safety protocols. there's another three researchers facing his backlash the day after tomorrow. we just can't condone it or be party to it, so we want to get away.",1
"I backed away from him and then turned to run. before I could take five steps, I was in his arms and we were racing across the lab like a flash of inspiration. no I sobbed as the results from the experiment became a blur.",1
"it had a damnable side effect of causing a person to open their notebook and reveal their deepest findings, especially if those findings had to do with groundbreaking discoveries.",1
"she was debugging and coding and doing whatever tech-savvy thing she does, said Mrs. Hamilton, her steel grey eyes scanning the bustling crowd of developers and engineers.",1
"I just need to grab my laptop from upstairs then we can go, she announced. she walked unsteadily and gripped the railing for support as she climbed the stairs. this isn't good, Colin whispered, when she was out of sight.",1
we stood there as the screens flickered between both of the settings. I knew he was expecting me to choose an option to select. I also knew he would make that decision in the end.,1
"I had visited this server farm before during my nocturnal coding sessions, had gotten to know some of the colleagues who frequented this place. as I made my way toward the underground data center, I feared that there would be more issues—many more.",1
"Jill had assured me back at the office that she could operate the drone, although she had never piloted anything in her life and never had a lesson. she told me she had read the manual for the drone and was confident that together we could figure the thing out.",1
she unrolled the blueprint and laid it out on the meeting table.,1
their lack of strong emotional ties facilitated their acclimation to the life of a tech team. it also created a divide between them and Eve that was undeniable.,1
"he handed them his security credentials and waited as they carefully scanned it. this is the expert they said might be able to improve it, one technician said.",1
they have arranged for your workstation there and you would learn in detail about the issue from this engineer and her manager and thereafter I'll talk with you once again before you start.,1
his son grinned and motioned to the mad coder racing flat out into the testing phase with her laptop raised.,1
"he knew that the other was trying to keep them from looking at the negative comments, to keep the fear from growing as they waited.",1
"for a while we just stay that way, me on my bed and Mavis updating me on her followers' reactions.",1
"he liked to use other influencers to do the talking for him. Tara also looked about inquisitively at them, noting their serene tone.",1
"at length she recollected the whole hideous scene in the comment section, and finally recalled the strange troll figure in whose words she had sunk into despair. D'Arnot wondered what fate lay in store for her now. she could neither see nor hear any signs of support around her.",1
"he made his way to a social media page that I had yet to see, due to the masses of followers posting updates in the way.",1
"he found viral content carefully stored in a hidden folder in the social media manager's archive. the password was changed, as the possibility of making duplicate accounts was high.",1
"he knew that he wasn't pronouncing the hashtags correctly, but thought, what the hell, I think he understood me. the moderator, in his mid-thirties smiled, checked out Rick's profile picture before commenting.",1
Kathleen pushed away from the trending topic and stepped back into the dimness of the forum where Tommy lay in the presence of his friends.,1
you're to carry me away with courage and honor while my sister attempts to stop you by using any means necessary.,1
"I turn away from them; I can't let myself be distracted. I have to focus on my grim task, and it's now or never; I have to report the user who attacked Preacher online.",1
"two security guards stood watch and he knew they wouldn’t allow them to simply walk in and inspect the office. he hoped Bart knew what he was doing, the place looked pretty daunting.",1
she closed the distance between them to hand him the report.,1
the documents were signed by the manager with apparently genuine signatures but the manager had retired long before the documents were supposedly printed.,1
I picked up my briefcase and moved out into the hustle of the office.,1
"he moved closer, but stopped, obviously not willing to step between them.",1
"finding their mistakes were insignificant, she let out a sigh of relief.",1
"'yeah, I thought so,' he said, but he was much more interested to see that Gaia was unscrewing the cap of a bottle of sparkling water and pouring out a measure.",1
"when she first started this habit of lunch time donations, she began with fifty dollars a week and she would search out coworkers in need.",1
Juan said they fled back to their hometown when he was terminated.,1
"she manipulated Poppy into offering his report, forcing the issue. she even gave the team an excuse for why he hasn’t done it yet. she didn’t introduce herself, but everyone assumes my great-grandparents know all about her.",1
"he kept asking himself that, as well as wondering what he had done to his research. the sound of the door opening caught his attention and he glanced to it, expecting it to be Professor Louise. he was actually relieved when it was her assistant instead.",1
"as with most of the academic disagreements that resolved in heated debates, this one had to do with funding and recognition.",1
"he thought his arguments would slip, but it felt like he was walking on solid logic.",1
"what Peter did not know he could not be made to tell, nor need he contrive to play his part. it would have to be done tonight, before Aspen returned.",1
"no sooner did he step out of the lecture hall than the phone started ringing behind him. Jay leaned back against the office door and counted the rings. Hiram didn't give up easily, he had to give him that.",1
"with John Foster gone, there was no advisor in the department I could turn to for help, and I didn't have time to apply for any external grants.",1
the senior professors lord it over the rest and love every second of it. the junior faculty desperately want to be taken seriously and are constantly trying to prove themselves.,1
"despite his racing heart he was calm and careful as he began presenting his findings, clinging to the podium. he hung on tightly, blocking the sounds of his colleagues' whispers from his mind.",1
Professor Maccon moved them on from the pleasantries with a direct reminder.,1
it remained with him as his own personal exciting secret. he thought of it as the data from an unknown source. he sometimes whispered the strange name of the unknown theorist to himself when no one could hear.,1
"he shrugged, raising his open hands to his shoulders, and she had to laugh. she did it softly so as not to wake Roland, but yes, she did have to laugh. a line from some old game had occurred to her: ""I play what I feel.""",1
"whatever the case, I loved this team now and I didn't want to go. much as I wanted to return to my hometown and family, I didn't want to leave.",1
he beat the locker so hard with his fists that she felt the concussion like multiple blasts of a bomb. she covered her ears against his shouts that were equal parts frustration and anger.,1
it was only as she put the car into gear that she remembered she forgot her gym bag.,1
a coach brought me here to frame me and make those managers think I sabotaged the game.,1
"no matter how much I might have told him to leave if he could not accept my training methods and strategies, I didn't actually want him to go.",1
"I knew I should leave it alone, but I just couldn't seem to bring myself to do so with the game on the line.",1
"he also felt relief that he didn't have to feel that way, and silently congratulated himself on having the good sense to have avoided falling in love with competition from the beginning.",1
"the stress of the match, particularly the final quarter, has worn me out.",1
"I realized it was Robin a second later, at the same time that she turned to look down. a look of surprise crossed her face during the brief second before her confident persona returned. she made to confront us, but his words rang out before she could.",1
"she is the finest business partner I've ever seen or met, but as I am now, I won't be good for the company nor will I use her for my personal gain or lie.",1
though be advised that he will attempt to come up with outlandish and wild excuses to explain his poor business decisions.,1
she staggered to her feet and watched as the four much larger security guards had to struggle to hold on to Wren. they surrounded him so well that Marguerite couldn't even see him anymore as they formed a barrier as if to protect her team.,1
when all of his efforts came to no avail he finally commanded her to be his business partner.,1
"he strode across the office, and Dunk was forced to hurry after him.",1
then Julio arrived at the conference room with a big smile on his face.,1
"after they arrived back at the headquarters, Allahandra had personally given them each a wax-sealed letter. the wax was red but the crest was clearly Allahandra's.",1
"as Alex hobbled in on her crutches with her dad and Aunt Meredith by her side, the whispers began among some of the employees who watched Alex come in. this must be the day that Alex would be pulled from the project, they quietly suggested among themselves.",1
"he was about to discard it when he stopped his hand cocked behind his head and lowered his arm, and decided to hold onto it. he had the small multi-tool and now he had some snacks to nibble on in a crunch if it came to it.",1
"Rachael connected an LCD projector to her laptop and made a statement that the information was classified as top secret, then began with some presentation slides.",1
"she not only knew the policies, but she knew them better than he did.",1
"the diplomat entreated the guard pleasantly, enquiring simply of the senator's whereabouts. all had gone to the event, for they’d been nearly two weeks in session, was all the guard was inclined to offer.",1
it is time to move toward the debate where the exchange of ideas will take place.,1
"trust me, you have no idea how bad you're going to feel if you don't cast your vote.",1
it was his voting record that made me know I’d chosen the correct candidate off the list.,1
"you are a far better leader than I ever hope to be and I would not only be honored to be your running mate, but eternally overjoyed. I support you, with all that I am, with all that I ever hope to achieve.",1
"as she took the seat across from him, she thought of her mentors, sitting together at their table in that influential house of theirs.",1
"Hiro smacked her foot away, bringing the brief closer to him while glaring up at Anna.",1
"he was blind, but he was not born that way, Chetsune continued. this man is fully human, but his experience has been severely altered. do you believe he was made blind in order to silence the protesters?",1
"he turned to leave, and saw a closed office secured by a wooden bolt. he went to it, stood before it for a moment, then drew one of the big documents he carried low in his briefcase.",1
"Ryan noted that the entire incident had barely drawn the attention of the gallery visitors. most continued their browsing, eyes averted and steps slowed just a bit more, perhaps pretending that if they just ignored the situation it would somehow go away.",1
he shifts onto his side and props himself up on an easel.,1
"when I started teaching him painting techniques down by the pier, a crowd would gather and soon we had a full class of locals and touring artists alike.",1
"all we need now is your signature, the gallery manager told her. again, there was no response as she tried to hear what was being said in the critique room. don’t clam up on us now, the curator said sternly.",1
"I closed my eyes and tried to remember what happened. after a few seconds, the memory of Susan being carried away by the exhibit thief came back to me and my breath caught in my throat.",1
I resisted a powerful impulse to run to her; that had availed me nothing a month earlier. an older artist perhaps twice her experience followed her every step.,1
"he would undoubtedly destroy her piece at the least provocation, and then regret his action for eternity. he had to protect Rina’s art from Kalin, and protect Kalin from himself—a difficult task requiring shrewd thinking.",1
"even Jim, who had been morose and withdrawn all evening, was drawn into conversation with Frank about modern painting.",1
she rested her head on Oseth's shoulder and realized it was his turn to contribute to the storytelling session.,1
you two can sleep on the studio couches out here while you think about where you will exhibit next.,1
"she didn't wait for the guitarist to finish, but cut in with a few riffs of her own, challenging for the crowd's attention and suddenly understanding why they called this a battle of the bands.",1
"since none of you let me do anything except sit and keep an eye on the mixing board, I learned about half of your song preferences. Natana, your manager called for you eleven times today, from what I heard, and learned your name after the third hit.",1
he was so excited he was getting to attend one of the concerts. he wished he was there to see it in person.,1
"no, he was definitely not an exceptional individual in any particular aspect of music theory.",1
"Marlin strummed his guitar, and suddenly the dissonant chords became harmonious melodies, all of which enveloped the room in musical bliss.",1
"I am here with records, extravagant gigs and plenty to perform, and fans to keep me busy, but I will tell you a secret. she turned toward me and whispered conspiratorially, I am not happy.",1
"he pulled his hand back, then swung it forward with as much force as he could put behind it. the drumstick found its mark and struck the cymbal perfectly.",1
"she went to the telephone and got out the address book and searched for every possible person with the name Collins who related to the music industry. she tried for over an hour to locate him, but was unable to.",1
"she remained stock-still and closed her eyes, letting the rhythm wash over her. moments passed and she opened her eyes again and breathed a sigh of relief.",1
he wondered if she was there and contemplated driving off the stage to her house. he thought about the clothes he had on and changed his mind. he had put on an old band t-shirt that had hardly any print left on it.,1
"he had recognized early on the ability of the community organizer, and realized the better decisions the council had made had actually been suggested by the smaller group.",1
"Alex made her way back to the community center, where I caught up with her, just as she went into labor.",1
even those who supported the losing candidates in the neighborhood election were suddenly swept up in the exuberance.,1
I'll miss Fiachna dreadfully and I want him to know that.,1
"I start out by leaning on his shoulder, but I'm so wobbly he just scoops me up and carries me upstairs. he tucks me in and says good night but I catch his hand and hold him there.",1
"I start scanning the books on the shelves of the local library, looking for the community history books I need. after several minutes, convinced someone has already taken them out, I move onto the next row, and that is when I see him.",1
"when at last she was able to release her son, he and Riyan left and headed over to the community office.",1
"he stood in the doorway for several tense seconds and then grunted and walked off, leaving her to unpack. she forced herself to take deep breaths as she moved to the door and slammed the bolt home, remaining outwardly calm even as she seethed with quiet rage.",1
"after Terri had been taken into social care, her father had had more kids.",1
"Bernard bent down and kissed her forehead, then rose, leaving the community gathering.",1
"it is said, that the scientists present today, are learning to harness the power of their minds. they learn to vibrate at higher frequencies and develop groundbreaking theories.",1
"lost in thought for several minutes, she had taken her eyes off of her research subjects.",1
"they might even care about your research if you presented it properly, but if you don't you can't blame them for the distance between the two of you... you have so much data to analyze, don't run from the challenge, embrace it and learn from it.",1
"whatever was in that lab was dangerous and best to avoid if possible. I wanted to save our energy for our final experiment with the high-energy collider, and not waste it on preliminary tests.",1
"I shook my head, closed my eyes, and tried to remember to breathe. how ever did you do this all alone when you came to the research facility?",1
he was describing a concept she had never heard before. it was the most extraordinarily beautiful hypothesis she had ever heard.,1
"Auron tried to be the better scientist, for he saw no profit in confronting Barvoch.",1
I open the lab door for her as she comes near.,1
"it took him fourteen trials, but in the end he proved the hypothesis.",1
"my heart had jumped at the sight of his keen observation on my data, which made me panic. I admired Gareth for his expertise, but never had I thought past it. was it possible for me to have fallen for him?",1
"Luca, who knowing all that you now know, chose to breach the system instead of securing it and worse yet, he chose to try and lie about it.",1
he reached into his pocket and pulled out a thick USB drive.,1
"since everyone had been accounted for except the missing IT specialist, the data breach charge brought against them was officially still in effect, the security chief had said, until Mariana was found and cleared.",1
he started waving his arms around and yelling from his cubicle at me as I stayed at my desk laughing.,1
"so I, an expert in the language of technical jargon, slurred out various terms similar to what Angel said they were, and I was accepted into their developer group.",1
"they had made him look incompetent in front of his own team and the project manager, already eager to latch upon any excuse to deny them resources.",1
"so she decided her reply would reflect that, ""Neither do you,"" then she poked her tongue out at him.",1
"John had to know it was some kind of trick, but he started troubleshooting anyway. I wished Liv were here to see how brave he was.",1
"when you feel like you're burning up inside, you just let the frustration out. the trick is to learn to center yourself, and own that energy.",1
"the system crashed as Jerrod twisted the code and the bug widened. the program dropped to the ground, dead before it rebooted. another process, a tall, sprawling service, saw what happened and logged an error, but Jerrod's job was done.",1
"I spent my life being not as influential, not as viral, as those around me, but in that moment, it was brought home to me that I could be their influencer, but I would never be their equal.",1
"she whispered the last comment into my DMs, so close her words moved my heart.",1
"he waited for Adri to like the post in answer, gave her an extravagant emoji reaction, and strode gracefully and silently to the admin's profile. opening a message, he produced a detailed response, then motioned for Adri to come.",1
"I couldn't help the love of my life go viral, so I certainly can't help him trend.",1
"she instructed Tasha to share the recipe as she had done. once Tasha had complied, Ann took her co-blogger’s hands in her own, and allowed their joint effort to shine in the post.",1
I was grabbing some clothes out of my drawer when Evan walked into my livestream.,1
"he wiped the code on the dead program’s logs, got up and returned to where James laid unconscious on the server floor. he checked James' data flow and was relieved that it still lived.",1
"Edeline glanced at Ember, who seemed on the brink, already, of going viral herself. she had gained more than a thousand followers since the morning, and her profile was bursting out with all sorts of new content and engagement previously unimaginable in her perpetual low reach.",1
I was on my feet and running up the digital stairs two notifications at a time toward Julian's update.,1
I had purposely not set the notification and it was the light coming in through the screen that caused my eyes to open.,1
"Kat seemed to vibrate with excitement as she stuck out her hand for me to shake. I did, feeling the pressure of her grasp through the fabric of my glove. ""So glad to meet you,"" she squealed, and I could tell she meant it.",1
"his throat worked, but he didn't question what I knew or the manner in which I'd acquired the information.",1
he shakes his head as he drags his eyes up and down my trembling presentation notes.,1
their discomfort lasted for another thirty minutes before Urie pulled off the highway and hid the company car out of sight.,1
"Tinker had been observing Sarge going through the meeting notes and wondered what he was looking for. her curiosity finally got the better of her and she moved over closer and asked, ""Sarge, what in the world are you looking for?""",1
"he debated taking the elevator to the main floor, but sometimes it was slower than it should be.",1
he rationalized the situation and knew that this so-called partnership wouldn't stand up in any boardroom he recognized.,1
"the cultural norms for workplace experimenting are different here, Amy said.",1
"he pulled on a tools belt, sheathed several differently sized wrenches, then stooped and began to pack equipment into one sack and the small bundles of documents into another.",1
"everything in him screamed to run forward, to wrap his work-hardened hands around that idea and squeeze the potential out of it. his cry of excitement rose only to gurgle to a halt, never leaving him.",1
I expected to see all of the things Melissa had described in the lab.,1
"I give him a sharp look, ""You just want to use your research skills, don't you?""",1
"they were concerned about the possibility that he has been experimenting with some unapproved methods, perhaps something unknown.",1
he would tense as if bracing himself for my critique. but I would never hurt him or criticize him in such a manner.,1
"the professor says somebody spotted her at the conference, but not when or which session.",1
it's important that you acquire this analytical skill first as you may find it hard to interpret while distracted by the data from the experiments around you.,1
"he approached the topic slowly, Dagmar's interest arching into his lecture while he planted tiny references against her thesis and hypothesis.",1
"as is customary among academic instructors, Tumorg employs rigor to motivate his students.",1
"Archer's mouth curved in amusement, and I think it was the first time I saw him really engage in the seminar.",1
"so when Benedict asked, she said yes even before he had finished his academic proposal.",1
"it was Sebastian, and in another second he was right by my side, lifting me up off the field. his face was actually still with shock, a fairly tender and overwhelmed expression muddling his features, one completely at odds with the competitive character I was so sure he had.",1
"when they laid her arm down by her side, I could see several small, round marks, irregular bruises, and damaged capillaries just under the surface of the skin from the intense training.",1
he would have asked if he needed me to do a warm-up routine.,1
"you report to me, but I want you to work closely with the team captain. I expect this to grow to full team strength as more players arrive. Schmitt interjected, the senior coach in charge at Ysleta is Matt Berkowitz.",1
I raised my left arm and with my right index finger I drew a line the length of my forearm in preparation for the play.,1
"I would show the tournament officials Sir Horace's record, which proves that he still holds the national title.",1
"Isaac leaned over me, easily lifting me into his arms, my legs wrapped around his waist after crossing the finish line.",1
"I had a hard time keeping up with him through the crowd. people were bumping into me and stuff, but for Chax, they simply stepped aside, letting him pass to the locker room.",1
"in answer, Max took a ceramic bowl from beneath his duffle bag, and passed it to Tavi for hydration.",1
the athletes had pitched their tent under one shade and the other two men were camped under the opposite wing of the sports complex. even at this distance it was clear that the two groups were not fraternizing.,1
she would just be another unsuspecting investor in our little startup plan and maybe she would come out of this with a profit.,1
"he took a step closer to me and jabbed the business card in the air again, pink logo falling off it and fluttering onto the desk below.",1
"i think i can remember anything you have to tell me, stated Maximilian crossly during the meeting.",1
"there you are, young entrepreneur, don’t go leaping into deals without research.",1
"i wouldn't give Lasseur the satisfaction of agreeing with him, so i just grunted.",1
"she felt like the adrenaline was firing up in her veins, encouraging her to pitch the idea. it was an odd sensation and caught her completely off-guard.",1
"Jessica ran through all the marketing strategies she knew in her head. as soon as the investor had headed for the canapés, Jessica walked over to Clarence and, in a whisper, and still smiling, called him several of them.",1
"we just have to get used to this office space, he said, staring up at the walls and then at the conference room.",1
"Annwyl glared at Brastias and Morfyd, huddled together in a corner reviewing her pitch.",1
"if he did not release his grip on the venture soon, she would suffer an economic downfall and fail.",1
"he picked up the policy document, lifted up the lid to the middle console, and dropped the document down inside. then he returned his attention back to rummaging around in the briefing notes.",1
"he had many advisors during his long career, and it was not the first time he had been betrayed by a close confidant. max and Jennie stood in the crowd and quietly watched the hearing lead the politician out, with Jennie giving her a glare of contempt.",1
"he talks with a funny accent and Sir Horace says that is because he lived in somewhere called Normandy before he became Sir Horace's aide. Edmund was only seven when he left home and went to live in Sir Horace's mansion, which is very young to start work.",1
"Sydney stood at the podium edge, one sleeve of her suit bloodied but the other arm extended. with a determined push, Eve surged up and toward her, catching Sydney's hand and gripping it tightly.",1
"he kept ignoring her until she brought a hand up and rubbed her chest in discomfort. his eyes snapped up, and he looked on with focused interest during the debate.",1
I will step down as soon as you take the office.,1
"for seven days Budhil refused to acknowledge the presence of his visitor. he acted as though the lobbyist was not in his office, even when Cadfeal tried to ask questions of him. Daksha would check in on him frequently, but his visits were short and mostly perfunctory.",1
"it's led me to believe that what you and I need is a real alliance, with real partners. as much as I enjoy talking to you, darling, this isn't ever going to work politically.",1
"I turned off the microphone to hear better, but it was quiet.",1
"he spoke quietly, yet there was absolute command in his voice during the council meeting.",1
"he crossed over to the window and gazed at the bustling city below, imagining the inspiration it held.",1
she climbed in and sat uncomfortably next to an art supply bag.,1
as we prepare for a new artistic journey we ask you for creativity and inspiration.,1
"truly, this is a day that improves with the passing. you may not like Fiacail but he was correct in saying you need to rest. if you sleep your creative mind will relax and flourish more rapidly.",1
"he twisted his paintbrush in his hand, swinging it to the side.",1
"I took it and let her help me up, wincing as I felt my back, shoulder, and the entire left flank of my upper body beginning to bruise from the vigorous dance rehearsal.",1
"Jenks complained as I wrapped my legs around the ballet barre, securing my position.",1
it was all aces and he smiled revealing gold and silver teeth. the hardest part about holding a winning portfolio is the waiting. you know you're going to change the art scene but no one else does.,1
he disappeared into the studio just to come out running a few moments later with several voices yelling after him. he had grabbed a warm sweater for Taylor on his way out.,1
"Duke reached across the table, grabbed Goodspeed by the throat, and pulled. as Ken struggled, Duke reached into Goodspeed's artist smock pocket and removed the sketchbook he found there.",1
"I tried wrenching my arm back, tried to drag her out, away from the overwhelmed fans closing in on all sides.",1
"on the first day that Zora found out about Lea, Lea started wearing headphones more frequently, to avoid anyone else recognizing her.",1
"I shook my head, instantly flashing back to when I'd thought the same thing about Jack—that he had cheated at the band competition—but Cole was really to blame for the misunderstanding.",1
he managed to move his head slightly to look around at his surroundings backstage.,1
"she scanned the venue for signs of life, some were entering, some leaving, none were sufficient for their needs.",1
"I turned my head to one side and kissed the pulse in her wrist, then gently clasped her hands with mine, feeling the rhythm of her music.",1
"Shay pounded on the door and was about to yell for help when the man stopped laughing and called out to him, ""Shai, Shai, Shai, my son. has it been so long that you don't recognize me? I've come here to help you with your music, not scare the devil into you.""",1
"I kissed Doyle first, and he had to bend down to help me do it, then I kissed Rhys. he looked at me, and there was sadness on his face as the melody played softly.",1
"he had thought that for as long as he had known her, though he had never told Qasim this, of course.",1
"he kissed her back, then pulled her concert t-shirt from her body. he laid it over his near their feet, then he tucked her hair around her shoulders where his lips continued tracing. she felt his breath along her collarbone, and then at her neck.",1
"I dismissed him, sadly, I think, and rudely and thoughtlessly and I had a sense of him hovering near me, watching me, as I went on with the community meeting.",1
"she tried to concentrate, but she could only think that Birgitte had been right about organizing the event all along.",1
the volunteer stooped and unwound Luton's banner from the peg.,1
they begin to make plans for community gardens and public spaces for cargo and people.,1
he knelt by her side and cradled her head tenderly after the neighborhood cleanup.,1
"he was frustrated at how easily he lost his composure during the town council meeting. he went into a breathing exercise, timing his inhalations and exhalations. the first thing was to figure out what his next steps should be.",1
"back in the community center, Cady sauntered into the common area and sat down with a small sigh next to Nate on one of the chairs at the large table.",1
I ignored his less than subtle hint that I should reconcile with the other committee member. I liked Chuch but he didn't see the big picture. he didn't know I'd spent two weeks negotiating community resources.,1
"Peter turned and winked at Michael, then made for the stairs of the community hall.",1
"we also have fingerprint, retinal, and ID card scans, and have to step through special security gates. Beetee has to leave his wheelchair outside, although they provide him with another once we're through security.",1
Talon thought about the hypothesis and he felt a twinge of doubt.,1
"it was something he had been pondering for a while now, and he knew what experiment he wanted to conduct.",1
"yet, the fact that I hadn't already been dismissed was a good sign, and though his expression more or less remained unchanged, there was a spark of curiosity in his eyes.",1
"she walked past him with her arms wrapped around herself, laughed, and shivered in the cold of the lab.",1
Ash frowned at him as those words pricked at the times in his life when he'd been brought back from unsuccessful experiments against his will.,1
"he rushed forward to help the fallen test subject, and found himself grabbing hold of a hand that was nothing more than polished bone, smooth and rather yellowed like an old specimen.",1
"for the next couple of days, Neste rose at the same time and walked to the research facility on her crutches. Glynis and her supervisor both disapproved, but Neste needed that much independence. her leg ached constantly, but it also got stronger every day.",1
he wondered if she needed to know any of the data.,1
"toward the end of the day, Eddie had found a bright yellow flower beside the path and had picked it for her to examine.",1
"it doesn't matter if she goes home exhausted, since her parents are out at some scientific conference and won't be back until Monday. Coby's off with their grandparents, but Tex had been allowed to stay alone in the lab.",1
"I think all of us are too thin on resources these days. new tech is scarce, so it's a good day if any of us have had one decent upgrade.",1
"Stenn had spent most of his life seeing the collaboration between Samuel and Marianne. that kind of teamwork is what he had wanted to feel in his own projects. there's another promise for you, Tania, Stenn thought, we'll be as successful as they once were, if we're not already.",1
"I wouldn't have thought that any device could survive that much damage. but the server drew in a ragged boot-up, and blinked open one indicator light. the other had been put out, and its port looked sunken and strange.",1
the team leaders all agreed that they could not leave until the issue with the network was somehow clarified.,1
he called out to the IT support but there was no reply.,1
they strolled down the server room and reached the entrance to the mainframe.,1
"his hand stroked the smooth surface of the device there and, without further prompting, slid over to the power button.",1
"we must always complete our deployments with no hesitation and with no remorse. our data must not rule our logic or our actions. in our line of technology, it can only bring failure.",1
"my heart started pounding when I thought of the way he’d glared at me the other night, through his smartphone screen.",1
"this way we had a better chance of meeting a wide variety of developers in the hope of finding some positive leads in the project. although the morning's coding lessons were ok, we were really only going through the motions as we had no intention of doing any actual coding.",1
he turned to look at them as they left and Freya glanced over her shoulder back to him. their profile pictures locked for a brief second before she broke the contact and turned her attention forward once more.,1
"a little dumbstruck, he slowly closed the laptop and the rest of the notifications out, and successfully closed himself in with a post that had come out of nowhere and changed a big part of the feed.",1
"so far his friend has been mum, but I've managed to learn a good deal about what's trending below Ashwood.",1
"there's a strong possibility that the rest of the algorithm is unstable. it may explain why they seem unconcerned about monitoring it. however, I believe it's our best chance of going viral without being detected.",1
"we do need to have a video chat and figure some things out, though.",1
I didn't miss the torment in his eyes as he averted his gaze from the negative comments.,1
"yet when speaking her last request to him, to tell the moderator good-bye, she used his handle. had she finally reached some level of respect for him?",1
"after turning off the notifications, he readied for the night with a swift efficiency born of years of online influence.",1
"she primed her profile by candle light in preparation for a special post from her mother. after showing Millie how to set up the feed with the right amount of hashtags, she logged in. it was her mother that had taught her to add the essence of lilac to her posts.",1
"the sight of it did nothing but deepen her fury, and she stepped toward him with her fingers poised to type a fiery response.",1
"she turned and walked quickly away, Choja's eyes following her through the office.",1
"Lamare was looking at him, shooting daggers with her eyes during the team meeting.",1
"I wasn't exactly the type that people opened up to, so I wasn't sure what to do with that confidential information.",1
he allowed himself to savor the moment and just looked at her repeatedly without a word as they presented their project.,1
"he asked, and she could hear the uncertainty in his voice during the budget review.",1
"he finally tore his intense gaze from Ash's face and fastened it on her, but thankfully the rigid line of his jaw relaxed a bit as he looked at her.",1
"after they were gone, he examined where they had come from and found a trigger switch that opened a hidden compartment, leading to another workstation. more IT staff were coming and he almost got caught, diving into the meeting room from the edge of the hallway, the IT staff hot on his trail.",1
"I glanced up, and the first thing I saw was a middle-aged manager in a tweed suit with a fine woolen tie and an expression seriously at odds with the thoroughly affluent air that he emanated. I just snorted and did not bother to answer Amanda.",1
as soon as the door clicked closed Edna leapt for the phone to call the client.,1
"he was safely in his executive limo before he realized that he had bought the bracelet quite legitimately online; it looked more expensive than it really was, she must have something else on him.",1
"finally, they were allowed to rise, and Rurik kicked into full professor mode, demanding an assessment of all research and issuing deadlines for students and assistants. he had a few tasks for me - more assignments that made me seem scholarly - before finally declaring I could leave.",1
"she realized that she could still see the glow of her study lamp, but then it was blotted out as the experiment demanded her attention.",1
Kim merely shook her head and continued to stare out of the window of the university library.,1
he slid his finger down and drew teasing lines around her notation on the research paper.,1
"surely you can find a way to leverage the current data? biotech is going to be the field of the future, and here we are, sitting on a virtual gold mine!",1
"you need to be careful when you go home to visit, Michelle declared matter-of-factly, knowing the pressure of academic expectations.",1
"Professor Boone was yelling at the two undergraduates in the research laboratory. from the past, there was an old adage that even the best student had a mentor.",1
"I asked G-Mom and Grandma to wait with my study group while I quickly searched for Lyle. he was soaked in stress by the time I discovered his whereabouts. a glance over my shoulder revealed my team, eyes wide and mouths covered as they witnessed the ordeal.",1
"Claire wondered whether to comment on her friend's pasty complexion, stark against the pillar-box red hair, a sign of too many sleepless nights.",1
"she gestured discreetly for him to give her his annotated bibliography, which he handed over reluctantly.",1
"they loved pointing out she looked nothing like her mom. with Eliza's warm smile and delicate features, Hannah understood everyone's admiration for her mother's athletic grace. even dressed in an old jersey and sweatpants like she wore now, her mother still looked stunning.",1
the four athletes bought their gear and left the stadium before anyone had a chance to accuse them of anything.,1
"his tiny mom was a talented coach, but the heavy, overdone team makeup made her look a lot older than her twenty-eight years and he hated when she teased her blond hair out for press conferences. it made her look tired and his mom was anything but.",1
"so the Lipwig fellow thought he controlled the team, did he? well, you couldn't run the team without Mavolio Bent, and by this time tomorrow he, Cosmo Lavish, would own Mr. Bent.",1
"I am not about to hand you over to them, Lexel whispered. Zero would normally have been amazed by anyone noticing his moves without having seen him but right now he was focused on the game at hand.",1
it was then that the referee explained that under no circumstances were they to change the lineup that Varvara had set.,1
"she tried to imagine the middle-aged coach, who harbored a generous heart beneath her no-nonsense, businesslike exterior, benching David Thornton. the rigorous training sessions that Belle was overseeing had definitely weakened her, leaving her open to the possibility of burnout.",1
"Marielle stared after him and wondered what that was about. then suddenly he spun lightly on his heel and approached her once more. meet me for breakfast at The Steel Dragon, he invited.",1
"after a few words all three athletes were grinning ear to ear, and the whole team walked down to the locker room.",1
"Jake, I'm sorry to tell you that nowadays that's just the way some athletes like to look. he put his hand on Jake's shoulder and this time Jake did not object, maybe that was progress.",1
"it looked like I wasn’t going to get a lot out of him, meaning I had to take a bit of extreme measures to get my answer about the funding.",1
it was at that moment in time he had started to feel the urge to protect his business partner. his eyes darkened in jealousy when she spoke to other potential investors.,1
"since he didn't want to talk about the failed venture, of course I couldn't let it go. that aspect of my entrepreneurial spirit explained a great deal about my relationship with Chance.",1
some of the team members were lending their aid in getting everything situated properly for the product launch.,1
"she avoided the market competition, but her unsteady balance caused her to fall backwards, landing with a thud in the startup environment.",1
"I can get excluded from the consortium just for harboring her. more importantly, I could get a hefty reward for reporting her at the nearest tech incubator.",1
"I say we walk there and ask for help, Vanida declared the next morning at the networking event.",1
they could hear shouts in the ante-chamber as the former audience piled into the startup pitch room. Victor walked up the suddenly-deserted aisle to the back row and sat down in a vacated seat.,1
"he asked as he brought forth a large portion of a prototype for them to sit on. he laid it down to form a square around the brainstorming session and looked at her. um, sure, she said, unsure of what she could do.",1
"the others contemplated this, mulled it over, and decided she was probably right about the market strategy.",1
"he will try to sway you, perhaps he will try to discredit you. I have extricated you from political obscurity, Felton; I have caused you to be named lieutenant governor; I once saved your career, you know on what occasion.",1
he had done well and his negotiations had proven highly pertinent to the campaign.,1
"I had been numb and it was the only thing that made me feel again. on the sixth day her fever broke and the shivering stopped. I was asleep in the chair, holding her hand, when I felt her in my thoughts and sat up.",1
"she herself took a step backwards as another great blow shook the debate hall. from beneath the widening discussion, she heard them: voices, proclamations, slogans, chants, urges, each one brimming with purpose, each purpose rife with political fervor.",1
"something had to be done, even if it meant deviating from the approved policy.",1
"we have tried to wriggle out of it, but without success. we hope that you will pick the legislative locks that we have been unable to open.",1
I laughed while we lifted our campaign signs and paid for promotions—20 dollars from my side and 20 from her side.,1
"she could only hope she would do well enough to impress the party leader, Santino.",1
"on at least one occasion, after taking a hit in the press during a scandal in Uzbekistan, Horsa had a herd of 300 promises butchered and left them to rot in the public discourse.",1
he held a policy brief in one hand and a speech in the other.,1
"he carried me down to his studio, opened the door for me, and gently placed me inside. he handed me a paintbrush, and I weakly rolled my eyes at the gesture.",1
he didn't see the critique coming until she'd handed it to him. but he was fast—too fast—and turned just in time to have it pierce his ego instead of his confidence.,1
"he took my palette, but let go of it again at once when he saw the look in my eyes.",1
"Avalon turned to face me, his expression still hard and critical.",1
I vaguely remembered hearing someone mention another gallery attached to this one underground but had no idea what or who was displayed there.,1
"on leaving the exhibition room Hamish noted that the urgency of unloading his art supplies seemed to be understood. someone had unwrapped his canvases, but left the easels untouched. after the initial display of action the assistants were now, presumably, rearranging things in the storage, as they were nowhere to be seen.",1
"I have to be there for the unveiling and administer the final touches as soon as possible. right now both seem to be in Venice, Italy, but have separated. we know the general area at least and our first target is the sculpture.",1
"I had meant it to be sarcastic, but my mentor nodded, totally serious. a car had pulled up outside, and Takata headed for the art supplies.",1
"he sounded like a little boy who didn't get his way, and actually started to look like it when he stamped his feet a few times in frustration at his latest piece.",1
I save your masterpiece and this is the gratitude I get?,1
"I wanted to walk under the stars after the concert with you, she said. I'm glad I could accommodate you, I said, as we began walking again down Rook Street, turning on Taurus, past the venues that were closing up for the night.",1
"she felt almost drunk on euphoria, but alive as never before, connected to a musician who seemed desperate for her.",1
"he found himself humming a verse of a symphony about triumph, a melody that his mother used to sing to him before he went to sleep.",1
"Let's get this over with, the singer remarked to Oaka, then he stretched a little bit before he took his place on stage, ready to perform. Oaka quickly took his own stance, hoping that he was ready for this.",1
"Musicians entered and exited from both sides throughout the day. all wore the same branded t-shirts and walked with the same confident posture, rendering them indistinguishable from each other. it was so confusing I almost gave up keeping track of them.",1
"at first, she hadn't recognized that tone for the luscious contradiction it was. she had heard only the innocence, and had continued searching for someone with the qualities she'd always found most attractive in a voice: brooding, dangerous and powerful.",1
"her two brothers, performers in their own right, were grown men with bands of their own and visited often, bringing their partners and children to share in noisy, cheerful jam sessions that lasted well into the night.",1
"in all likelihood, Dan will expect us to stick to the setlist. he will check here first, since we have spent most of our rehearsals here.",1
"his eyes strayed, threatening to return to the sheet music, so I poked him again with my foot.",1
"once in the capitol region, he left the highway and began navigating the one-way streets near her place. he never liked city driving, but it didn't dampen his excitement about the gig one bit.",1
"I ended with a hopeful lift to my voice, and then expectantly waited for his response at the community meeting.",1
I was then sent to a local carpentry workshop to be apprenticed there and after five months that also came to an end. all the time I was pining for the mountains and the great outdoors. back home on the farm I wasn't very popular as I had failed.,1
"the volunteer shrugs and says, get in it and zip it up before the clean-up starts.",1
"he was only five years old and Celeste was rather surprised the first time he showed up at her door with questions about the community garden. his little face was flush and the first thing he said to her was, hello.",1
Sumi looked up at him with a bright smile that wrenched his gut. she kissed Kalea's cheek and handed her off to his grandmother before she excused herself from the neighborhood event.,1
he lowered her carefully to her feet but she had no strength in them and slumped back over his shoulder as they left the community center.,1
"Pheidippus of Calymne flew into a rage within minutes of his arrival, when he was told he would have to camp among the trees during the town festival. he took it as a personal insult: other guests are housed, so why should he not be?",1
"well, now he would just have to deal with the consequences of his actions at the community board meeting.",1
Jasper released his hold on her and helped her to her feet after they completed the community project.,1
"I only mention all this as a window to our minds at that time, so you can sense how we were thinking during the neighbourhood redevelopment discussions.",1
"Several months earlier, he had seen her flip her wrist, sending an attacking drone flying through the air with her exoskeleton suit.",1
"As far as Dali was aware, he had only a handful of half-brothers and sisters out there, none of whom he had ever met. They were all part of separate research teams.",1
"Marcus stared at the back of the young scientist's head for a moment. if Professor Aquitaine saw Crassus like this, she'd be hard-pressed to hide her satisfaction. He could be no threat to her lead researcher Arnos's scientific laurels, like this.",1
"He found it still hard to breathe and he constantly turned, listening to data from the laboratory beckoning him in a language that one time, he was sure, he had known.",1
Mrs. Wilson has always been good to you lab assistants and you should show some respect.,1
"Quinn didn't say anything, and for that, I was grateful. My thoughts were a mess, going fifty different ways, and right then, I didn't have a hope of coping with any sort of scientific debate.",1
"She drew her electrodes, blindly disconnecting the malfunctioning robot who tried to tear him from her arms. Immediately, the other machines threw her on the ground and closed on her to shock her again and again, and again. She felt the wires of one of them reach beneath her lab coat.",1
"Later, as Ariel thought more about her handshake with Dr. Baldur, she started to wonder if it wouldn't be logical for her to interact with more people, not less, within the scientific community.",1
"My anxiety increased tenfold when I stepped outside and saw Bryce's lab equipment in my workspace. I definitely wasn't looking forward to dealing with Bryce again. Jace tried to talk and joke around during the lab setup, but Bryce's crabby mood put a damper on any attempt at normal conversation.",1
Hauk waited until the other researchers were gone before he knocked the one unfortunate assistant who'd been left behind unconscious.,1
I was selfish to ask him to carry out what should be my project.,1
"the third man pulled out two crescent-shaped USB drives from the folds of his beige blazer and slashed at her. her layered clothing was too cumbersome for her to dart away fast enough, so as he swiped for her laptop, she bent back.",1
"some developers have zero clue as to what they're doing, and then when you add in new tech and the whole new and exciting startup thing, it just makes everything better.",1
"his fanaticism rekindled, and he made an ill-fated trip to Silicon Valley and a questionable startup.",1
"if I am to keep my company and regain their loyalty, I need to defeat this competitor in open market competition.",1
"keeping his stolen data became an obsession for him, and the plan he devised to hide it had to be foolproof.",1
"she moaned in her sleep, as if she had been reading his code and was now agreeing with every line he wrote. satisfied with his conclusion, Aidan settled further back and rested against the bed's headboard. after a minute had passed, he fell asleep with a clear mind.",1
in his teenage years Jackson had relied upon his large frame and fast hands. he would earn some additional income from hacking and freelance coding. the bruises on his master's face resembled the injuries he would receive from being hit.,1
"Thomas wasn't sure what he thought about having Victor as a witness, but he didn't really want to wait as they went to search out another collaborating developer.",1
"when the server room door opened fully, Kelly and I exchanged the same freaked-out expression.",1
"I danced a jig amusedly, watching Ben get more and more agitated as his post failed to go viral.",1
"he held her profile open with his fingers, nuzzling his attention against it, his comments sweeping across the sensitive sections of her photo.",1
I saw the notifications of your post and knew you must no longer be offline.,1
"things did seem to be going well for a while on my feed, until one day I noticed something strange in my follower count.",1
"it is a risk, yes, but one we can afford to take. the only difference between posting now and letting them come to us, is when we face the feedback.",1
"I could only do so much and decided to focus on my profile picture. I turned the filter on and adjusted the settings, editing it roughly. once it was polished, or at least clear of flaws and blemishes, I focused on my bio.",1
"he uttered a shocked cry and crawled away from the negative comments. Hoots countered with a positive reply, flipping the sentiment back.",1
he glanced at Karl again and saw a look of panic on the student's face as his post was being ignored.,1
"thank you, moderator, for letting me make a fool of myself and convincing you that I'm a troll. when it was time to go offline and shut down her computer, Phoebe checked her notifications and looked both ways before logging out completely.",1
"you have to be very careful with that post, warned Rebecca.",1
"These words didn't sound like Diana at all, or at least not like the Diana that Cassie had known in the office.",1
"Without knocking, he turned the knob and let himself into a small but elegant conference room.",1
"Warden Iris spared her a slight nod, but he watched only for physical threats. your wariness will be of no use against me, Warden. in Edon's office, Taya sat demurely on the edge of the chair Edon offered her, her hands crossed on her knee.",1
"Now she could see the speaker, she realized the voice didn't even sound like his usual professional tone.",1
"The employees who'd followed them had quit, been replaced, their contributions forgotten.",1
He yelled at one intern who tossed several files haphazardly into a box. those are confidential documents; you must treat them with care. the intern mumbled an apology and then returned inside the archive for more.,1
"Hector had never been disrespected in the workplace, but his will had been disregarded countless times. he knew the total devastation of feeling helplessness, the terror of being trapped in your position as other people made decisions for you.",1
"As she expected, the team made a pyramid of their reports next to the projector; but as soon as any of them got to within a couple of feet of the deadline, he was unable to defend himself against her critical feedback.",1
"Nolen pulled on his dress shirt, stuffing it into his unlaced trousers.",1
"Allrianne sighed dramatically, but turned and did as he asked, trailing off into the hallway. Elend turned back to Sazed, who was watching her with a curious expression.",1
"We would congratulate you on your publication, the department chair intoned, his ghostly image appearing in the presentation slide.",1
"Hacking his way through the dense theoretical frameworks with research, Eladio approached his professor's office with pride. when his younger classmates saw the impressive thesis resting benignly on Eladio’s shoulders, they cheered with delight.",1
"Amara's frustration faded, taking with it whatever motivation she had left after the long study session.",1
"She glared at him, then promptly returned to the study group. they had been given a single textbook to share, which she eyed longingly.",1
"Abby stepped away from her husband's crouched figure and headed into the library. when she reached the counter next to the computer, she slid open the top drawer and sifted through the papers inside using the light of her phone.",1
She had wondered if Carthinal had wanted to see Yssa to make some academic collaboration.,1
"The earth around them shook, and Rhona realized that Vigholf had moved a chair close so that Professor Agrippina could sit. he smiled at Rhona, quite proud of himself and she knew in that moment—she respected him. Professor Agrippina sat on the chair, and gave Vigholf a nod of thanks.",1
"As much as I would like to participate in your research, Jack, it is impossible.",1
"Personally, Duke didn't believe Shock was secretly working for good while pretending to serve academic bureaucracy. Shock merely placated both sides, knowing the winning side would appoint him to a tenure-track position eventually.",1
He graded the papers as quickly and as effortlessly as he had the others.,1
there was no way he could have gone outside the stadium and locked the door from the other side without a key.,1
she closed her eyes against the deepening afternoon light streaming through the arena.,1
"she is damnably clever, and horribly persistent, I grant you that. he scowled, while Arpan wagged a knowing finger his way from the sidelines.",1
"the coach grunted and hit the timer, and then they pulled out into practice drills. the sweat from the player's exertion streamed back directly into Magnus's face. he lifted a finger and redirected it away with a towel.",1
that would just about give us enough time to squeeze out of the locker room before the final whistle blew and the cheering crowd obscured my vision completely.,1
"she turned and smiled at Alex before looking at her teammates. her tone had become almost exuberant, her unseen frustration subsided for the moment. what each of you need to understand is that there is nothing that could stop him if he wanted to win the game.",1
her coach wiped the smile off her face as he tore her a new one for being late to practice.,1
"I'm about to tell the coach that is carrying out my suspension the truth about my abilities—a betrayal of myself, but I feel like he needs to know. he looks at me without saying a word, his eyebrows raised.",1
Arthur exclaimed as he picked himself out of the corner of the gym.,1
she knew it like she knew her hands were connected to her arms. and she couldn't pass up the only opportunities she'd ever have to play in the championship.,1
"For the first time in his life, he didn't know how he was going to handle a business challenge.",1
"He fought against the urge to lean into her, to share his entrepreneurial secrets.",1
"Ridcully tried to look as dignified as possible, given his startup's financial situation.",1
"You'd have to let the venture go eventually, and then what? She wouldn't trust Simon anymore, and she already doesn't trust you because you took credit for her idea.",1
"Except for the organization, no one knew how she managed the company.",1
"A young entrepreneur could, with encouragement and mentoring, eventually manage to pitch an entire business plan after just one workshop. this is an important skill when you're launching a startup.",1
"She was a heavy burden and her hand was slippery but he couldn't let go. with one arm wedged around the investor meeting table, he was secure but Cathy was still dangling above the sheer drop of financial ruin.",1
I rummaged through the office supplies and found some of my sister's motivational sticky notes.,1
"She was young for him, but ten years or so wasn't the end of the world in terms of experience difference in the business world.",1
"The crowd of investors parted, nodding frantically, as she passed through to slip into the boardroom.",1
Sarah shook her head and reached out with a limp hand to sign the bill.,1
He slid into the chair so recently occupied by the senator.,1
He turned to find her with a folder full of policy drafts and research that have been a staple of their campaign for as long as he could remember.,1
"I sigh miserably, then focus my efforts on the political wounds, broken alliances and ruptured public trust. it would be for the best if I stepped down, but I can't give up on my constituents.",1
Peter went to the back of the car pulling the minister with him as they hurried off the stage.,1
She caught it with one hand and used the other to open the committee's agenda.,1
"She didn’t ruin everything that made him the politician he was. he ran for office for his people, Anna, to uphold his nation, but first for you. The man would have stood alone and fought an entire congress for his policies, for you, Anna.",1
"I didn't mean to be so blunt, but I was worried about the election results.",1
"He has agreed to share his campaign strategies in exchange for his life. Lord Ran steps forward and holds up the proposal for the president to admire. as the president lifts the document, the cameras in the chamber flicker off its surface, making it appear powerful.",1
"The guilt forced me to look away from him, and I noticed then that Maddie and Doug had stopped their debating. Maddie was glancing over at the press pool, but Doug's eyes were on me.",1
"No, we're just supposed to make sure you attend, he replied, although he was staring at the gallery walls hungrily. Well, I'm not participating in any of this until I know it's curated properly, said Tara, folding her arms under her chest.",1
"Her hands were in her coat pockets, and she didn't hurry; she stopped to admire some sculptures in a studio window, checked out the pieces at Le Cirque.",1
"In return for her artistic services, she only asked that her only granddaughter be enrolled at their elite art academy.",1
"Dardan stood, glad that the curator was not one to needlessly prolong introductions.",1
"I see Ethan's father didn’t exaggerate everyone’s current disdain for his latest performance, Saundra said. Please understand I don't give a shit what you think about his art right now.",1
Tonight was no exception as he entered the theater sporting a bulbous red nose with the smell of paint on his clothes.,1
She ignored the surge and crash of bitter emotions that awoke with the name of her rival artist.,1
I thought someone on the other side might be doing exactly the same thing. of course I should look to see who was standing there in the studio.,1
"This didn’t make for a happy little boy and his parents could tell he was unhappy and tried to find the reason. Johnathon, being afraid of more criticism from his art teacher, kept it all to himself.",1
"I flew backwards and my head hit the pavement, the pain overwhelming, but all I could think about was saving Susan's painting. I scrambled back up and then cried out in horror as the wind swept it into the sky, carrying it like a rag doll into the darkness.",1
It was obvious that the time to ponder and rehearse had passed and the performance was upon us.,1
"Every disagreement, every song-writing session, every second we've spent together led up to this concert.",1
"Thorne was staggering right behind him, hitting the walls on both sides like a drunken man, sweat pouring down into his eyes.",1
"You could safely leave your record label now, she says slyly, nodding in my direction.",1
"Eldo called out to one of the band members as he tried to get up. Can someone lend me a guitar or -- Ama pushed him down and cried, are you crazy?",1
"It was like she only cared if you hit the wrong notes. It’s good to not let musicians' egos get too big. Vianez opened her mouth to say something to Reynold, but Blana stopped her.",1
"Once he rounded the door, he did run, but not for the exit. he took the first flight of stairs and started down it, two steps at a time, heading to the stage.",1
"After a while, she said what they consider classic hits has to change sometime.",1
"When his fingers tapped into her chords, aligning their harmony, she knocked her microphone against his. He bellowed with rage, until she squirmed around and drove her elbow back into his chest.",1
"I lowered my voice, even though I knew Rebecca was just as involved with our rehearsal as we were.",1
They stayed like that until the community hall door opened again and she heard Fearghus's voice announcing the start of the meeting.,1
"Rafe nodded bemusedly in agreement, but when he turned to Rand it was with a lingering frown about the community project.",1
"Excuse me, sir, called out one of the crowd, in a courteous and friendly tone, would you pull over to the side, please, and let us pass? We're organizing a parade.",1
Both of his parents were firm believers in better living through community engagement.,1
"He knew the man holding him and those with him had the advantage in numbers, so he kept it hidden and waited for the proper opportunity to volunteer his help. All remained silent at the neighborhood gathering.",1
It disturbed him more than he would admit that Nicolette was not there at the community event.,1
"Men like him transformed entire neighborhoods for fame and recognition. And for hundreds of years since then, he has fought for community causes, social justice, and the betterment of his kind.",1
"She then wrapped her arms around my neck and asked, how are you? How is the community center coming along?",1
We had been through so much together as a community in this past year.,1
"Lucien left the store and returned to the community garden, where he once again joined the neighborhood committee. He flashed to Anya's next location - and found her in a park organizing a cleanup.",1
Laurette glanced from Brina to Evalle with eyes begging for help understanding the data.,1
"I allowed her analytical skills to flow through me, her insights becoming my own. I could feel her concern and curiosity, her regret at having to question me, and her determination to validate the hypothesis at all costs.",1
"She felt a thrill shoot up her spine and invigorate her entire core before she asked, ""Professor, it will be quicker to let me analyze your findings.""",1
"He couldn't recall it being done in his scientific career, but the circumstances justified the experiment.",1
"She gave a cry of relief when she saw him, then stopped when she saw the robotic assistant by his side.",1
"""In a year I'll expect you to present your research findings, and such assistance to you will cease,"" said the mentor.",1
She said as she stood up to get the first aid kit. after she finished bandaging the lab rat and putting splints on both parts of its broken leg she was beyond exhaustion.,1
"""Now I realize that even a scientist can't get everything right! I try to learn from other researchers more, and even from students! So what I'm saying is, maybe I'm really more open to new ideas, now, than I was then!""",1
"As they sat before a roaring Bunsen burner in the lab that night swapping stories of the day's experiments, Jay felt himself right at home and eager to know more of his colleagues, and strangely, the scientific world in general.",1
"Miko found the broken apparatus, and tossed it down to James. Catching it, James raised it up toward the lab bench. holding it steady, he put the end against the stand and pressed firmly.",1
"today's tech enthusiasts thought that the company's policy of open-source tolerance was too lenient, apparently. today's tech enthusiasts wanted to innovate rapidly, and had conveniently decided that Magnus's protocols were outdated, every one.",1
"she looked up and caught the eye of a cheery looking middle-aged woman. sheltering in the co-working space doorway she gave Beth a warm welcome. come inside quickly love, and get out of the rain, you're soaking.",1
"hell, it was one of the things our tech team was known for, and I knew I was justifying what I would do next. I stood up so I could reach across the desk and touch his code.",1
he transports himself through data streams and assumes virtual form as needed. people fear him because he hacks directly into their systems and disables those who don't comply.,1
I turned and saw Avril and Pepper coming up the hallway. Pepper left her meeting and ran to meet her sister. Avril walked slowly toward us and I could tell something was wrong.,1
"he pulled away from her and gave her a murderous look, but she knew he wouldn’t dare do anything to the project. he led his team out of the meeting room with as much dignity as a weasel.",1
a notification on my phone jerked me out of my thoughts.,1
I was surprised no one had questioned what Gideon's engineers were doing there.,1
"there was no clear reason that she could think of. she scanned the email for any news on the merger, but there were none.",1
"instead, Edana had snatched a tablet from the chair in the corner of the room and handed it to him with a poorly hidden smile. Jesse flashed an angered and confused look, but took the tablet anyway.",1
He then changed his mind and got pissed at me for not wanting him to abandon his social media influencer dream.,1
"I worked there as a moderator for twelve years, and at first I liked it a lot.",1
"Seeing him, wanting him, and being unfollowed by him for the thousandth time held no appeal, so she'd done the unthinkable. she'd gone offline to receive a mental break she would actually survive.",1
"She could cope with Daniel being a bad commenter, he'd been like that all year, but if the others also thought she'd posted something wrong then she needed to think it over.",1
"Paul realized that although he hadn’t meant to focus his ability, his anger at Hodge had taken over. realizing his mistake too late, he watched as the man panicked even further and deleted the post, pulling out of the group with a screech.",1
"I watched without breathing, waiting for that deadly comment to reach up and sap life out of my post. but instead, Nathan did something I could not have expected.",1
"The brand offered him two gold ducats, which is the price Pigafetta paid for a rat when starving, but the influencer still wanted the sponsor deal.",1
"Before Orris could start the livestream with a hard slap on the desk, Anson whispered to the nervous co-host and stroked their arm.",1
"The algorithm really took a lot out of the reach, but left us alone. with us being so fortunate we've been pushing the account trying to engage some of the new followers.",1
"We are most glad that you are able to join our live event, he said.",1
"we were both lifted again on the company's vision, as we had been before, and hurriedly carried out of the boardroom, leaving the executives behind us.",1
"Ivana stepped into view before Jordan from the cover of gathered colleagues. when she was not far from Jordan, she endeavored to present her idea with her prepared hands. Jordan hindered her twice with the help of the whiteboard.",1
"she exhaled and crossed her skinny arms against her, wearing only a thin blazer, but nodded.",1
They are constantly telling each other about new projects and ideas to check out and then comparing them. their goal is to one day be able to support themselves and their families by innovating.,1

"As he spoke, Bax produced a roll of performance metrics from one of his briefcase's multitude of folders.",1
"I know you told me that theory Aidan has, but it still leaves unanswered questions. for instance, she raised her hand and ticked off her points on her fingers during the team meeting.",1
"Once inside the hospital doors, Amanda held her jacket closed to hide the coffee stains on her blouse. Hunter remained completely still and silent as Tate pushed the wheelchair through the bustling areas.",1
"The gathered employees took up the plea, the calls growing for the CEO to entertain them with a tale of his career bravery. the CEO bowed his head diffidently, waved a hand as if to dismiss such calls as unnecessary.",1
"she watched the lecturer move closer, his laser pointer raised and ready. suddenly, though, he lost his footing on the stage.",1
"Mia seemed to feel better than the last time he saw her on campus. during her first visit at Sebastian's office, she was even in a good mood.",1
"she shook her head, wishing she had Molly's eloquence at the seminar.",1
a technical issue goes off dangerously close to Chase and knocks him off his presentation.,1
I slept twenty minutes too late the next day and woke up to the awareness that my dorm was full of classmates.,1
she took Penora upstairs to help her pack while her father walked around the perimeter of their house putting protection spells on it.,1
do we destroy the outdated textbooks or do we return them to the library? I say we destroy them so there is no chance of the misinformation falling into the wrong hands.,1
I ran back up the stairs and dug out my smallest graduation gown.,1
"all the academic rules of debate will go out the window. you may have to contend with guerrilla tactics, and a hostile audience.",1
"he thinks it might be an eye strain, but doesn't know for sure. if the drops don't work, then I'm supposed to come back in five days for more tests. hopefully you won't have to wear your sunglasses to teach on Monday.",1
There were only two flights to Atlanta that night coming from destinations following inbound flights from Paris. He made it to the stadium much earlier than needed just to ensure that nothing was left to chance.,1
"I doubted she bought that strategy, but I really did want to see it.",1
"Her body had endured years of training, and now she had finally pushed it to its limits.",1
Mulder gave him his normal blank stare that revealed nothing about his thoughts on the game.,1
"People were supposed to take deep breaths when they warmed up, she'd remembered. She couldn't remember the last thing she'd said to Luke. weren't you supposed to remember the last thing you said to a teammate before a big game?",1
"At the break of dawn she visited the trainer on the edge of town. She paid the man for a large supply of sports tape. The trainer knew well enough not to ask too many questions, but he could not refrain from saying something before Runa hurried off.",1
Zafira cried out when an opponent grabbed her arm and jerked her back then shoved her to the ground.,1
"A minute later the field was deserted, as the athletes hurried to their positions.",1
"Gritting her teeth, Sorcha managed to get to her feet. But after two steps, she simply sank to her knees again, her legs exhausted from the match.",1
"So the coach had a strategy, and the players of this team were no less clever than in any other.",1
She looked back over her shoulder and gave Michael a reassuring smile as they prepared to pitch to investors.,1
"She was a thorn in his side, a torment to his entrepreneurial spirit, a challenge in need of a solution. He could never be what she needed, never provide the mentorship she sought.",1
"I ducked back, dropping to my knees, and rolling out of the path of the incoming feedback.",1
"He rested his hand on his laptop, thinking he would watch her presentation closely.",1
"I grabbed a business coat and wrapped it around myself to hide my disheveled state. We waited in silence until our turn came, answering accordingly when our names were called out. They didn't ask about Nerida, so they obviously knew her startup's reputation.",1
"One of the mentors secured Aiden's hands behind his back while the other dashed to combat the trio of competitors. Hagan ducked to avoid a question from the nearing investor, responding with a well-thought-out answer which expeditiously satisfied the inquiry.",1
"Rather than have given his business plan to a total stranger, he would have thought it was their own fault for attempting a venture without adequate preparation. The honesty of the realization gave him a twinge of momentary discomfort.",1
Steffor turned to Vejax who met his eye with an anticipated glare during the board meeting.,1
"When Veshir saw the profit margins on the report, his expression grew dark. He tied up the loose ends of the project, then trotted over to Renald, but said nothing.",1
"I haven't been watching over her progress the way I should, the way I used to as a mentor. After all, it was Gale who checked our project milestones, not me.",1
A record is necessary to prove continued efforts to find and salvage any lost piece of legislation that has been debated.,1
"They rushed him at the chamber door, slamming him against it.",1
"Since I was still blocked off from the outside, I had no way of searching for an answer. I wondered if I were still connected to the political advisors if I would have been forewarned about any impending scandal.",1
He held out a small box with a clear top and an envelope. The envelope doesn't have any white powder on it or anything.,1
"A lot of people in the council didn't like me much. I'd go down with Morgan, for giving aid and comfort to a political rival. I suddenly felt naive and vulnerable and maybe a little stupid.",1
She explained the news articles in Venezuela that had the effect of undermining the trace of financial transfers in the national bank.,1
"It was real enough though, only it wasn’t considered a good idea to send the high marshal into the political debate, or particularly not in bright, attention-grabbing attire.",1
"Lina shook her head and made a grunting noise, while Collin forged ahead in the debate.",1
"The spokesperson looked at him in surprise: if you are going to argue, this means that things look dire. It is useless to rely on rhetoric alone in this city.",1
"I took a deep breath, summoning every ounce of strength I had in me, and wrapped my arms around Alex's neck, linking my fingers together tightly. Alex put his arms around my waist and pushed me so far into him I swear the political tension was going to weld us together.",1
"And she probably knows it already, but artists like that are unwilling to change. That’s why they go to critics in the first place.",1
"Paul had noticed his mentor’s presence from the corner of his eye, and it served to give him more courage and conviction. Great Bear had been watching this escalate from his comfy vantage point, he'd seen Kelly’s artistic style, and the effect it was having on Paul.",1
"She sat on the sofa in the studio, leaning forward so that her elbows rested on her spread knees, sketchbook in hand.",1
"So on that day we decided, what harm could it do? We pulled one another, for without Mother’s easel the ascent is difficult, and thought we would present our work as our father wanted.",1
Jacob and I slowly turned around until we were facing him. Now he didn't look like the artist I saw before at the gallery.,1
"His friend Ted’s face was on his canvas, and he watched in horror as his digital art licked the red and white stripes from his friend's painting. Sam tried to remove his artwork but it was too late—it had already gone viral.",1
An exotic floral arrangement adorned the middle of the table. Kiran walked over to the table and pulled out a chair for me. We were alone so far in the gallery and I was thankful for that.,1
"I want them to see progress, I want them to see you finishing up the mural. These folks got a stake in the community art project.",1
"Besides, she owed Jessamine something now, and the last thing in the world the other artist wanted to do, clearly, was go home.",1
The local arts council is going around and asking people not to go around and avoid the performance at all cost.,1
"Markus turned to see his youngest adopted daughter, Matarina, standing behind him, clutching her violin.",1
"As he stood and turned to leave, a glint of a silver guitar pick caught his attention and he turned back. while White continued to drum steadily, Blue slid his hand to his waist and began to draw his harmonica.",1
"She handled the sound check at the south east gate, and she had realised who the agents were scouting and promoting: the wealthiest of the musicians, that's who. I was there when she realised it, almost breaking down in a complete fit when she realised her own complicity, and mine.",1
"I glanced over my shoulder, wishing once again I could see the musical notes. Those affected by the melody would have to have appeared different, what was left of their creativity tainted somehow.",1
"Doak Garland embraced me when we reached his spot at the stage door, his white hands light on my shoulders so he wouldn't hurt me.",1
"I need to speak privately with the band accompanying me, at least one of them. She looked at each of us in turn, pausing on Helena with her cello only to offer her a nod, before stopping on me.",1
Logan pulled the guitar string back the same way he always did.,1
"He slowed his tempo, and she had no choice but to catch up to him.",1
"The revelation shook the conductor to his very soul, because there had been a time when there was no one more loyal than this soloist.",1

"After I'd carefully eased into the community center, he bent over to fasten my name tag and then rounded the table again to get to his seat. The coordinator leaned down to make sure I was sitting straight with all my materials in so she could close the meeting.",1
"I need to find my coral earrings, she said while continuing to rummage through the community sale items.",1
I grew up beside this neighbor my whole life and we didn’t even talk to each other until the neighborhood meeting yesterday.,1
"For too long, she'd wondered if he'd joined someone new in the neighborhood.",1
"She had sucked me into the community effort, played to my emotions and got my support without so much as breaking a sweat.",1
Otis had been unmoving for the last five minutes and his face had turned an ashen gray. Marcia had run to the edge of the community garden and dipped her handkerchief in the water. She tried to soothe Otis by patting the cool cloth on his warm forehead.,1
"I hadn't been able to handle volunteering with him anymore. It had been terrible, seeing someone I care about so much regard me with such contempt and disappointment during community projects.",1
She dashed to the edge of the community jetty and started unravelling the rope for the boat.,1
"I do believe you had quite the audience for your speech at the town hall, didn’t you?",1
I blinked hard and eased myself back on my elbows after the community clean-up event.,1
Danika thought perhaps she was staring at the discovery of a new species right now.,1
"The faithful scientists fled to their lab chief and told him what was happening, and together they prepared for a major breakthrough.",1
"Mostly he rearranged the lab equipment, calibrated a microscope or two, and completely re-did the experiment setup.",1
Wayne asked softly as they walked toward the laboratory.,1
"These researchers who supported me, my colleagues, have been waiting for this moment a very long time.",1
"Last year, not long after I'd met Seth, I'd discussed some of these same findings with Carter. He'd told me that no one - not even an outcast scientist - was beyond recognition and redemption.",1
I could almost hear a hint of curiosity in his tone.,1
"She approached, her heated excitement making her indifferent to the frigid laboratory temperature.",1
"Listening to her hypothesis, Tom was moved by an obscure curiosity that although unfounded, still unsettled him, the experimental data replaying again and again in his head.",1
"Unable to say all she felt, Claire had nodded in agreement at the request to analyze the data overnight, and had kissed Sky goodbye. Since then, she had lain on the uncomfortable laboratory chair and watched the rise and fall of Ruth's breathing on the lab monitor.",1
"Rafe turned to her and saw worry in her eyes. some of the technical stress and uncertainty that had scared her disappeared, and he smiled reassuringly.",1
"Her throat was tight, her hands were sweaty, and she was still holding onto the edges of her laptop with a fiendish grip. Brick crossed his arms and sighed at her, making a good show of appearing heartily disappointed in her coding errors.",1
"Amandie found that some of the engineers in the company had been quite fond of the retiring CTO, whom she did not know very well herself, whereas others gave a token of respect to his departure, or were clearly indifferent.",1
Alexia realized this must be the true source of Genevieve's distress over the software issues.,1
"Perry made a grumbling sound at the sight of the error message and I patted her shoulder, hoping that would make her feel better somehow and fully knowing that it wouldn't.",1
"Despite the protestations of Captain Marmaduke, Theo insisted that they eat off the cafeteria floor so as not to arouse suspicion during the tech conference.",1
"""Hey, my ears are burning,"" Danny said, entering the server room with Van at his side.",1
He lit one and took a draw with his eyes closed after the long coding session.,1
"When Alexia finally dropped back, they were both panting again from the intense brainstorming session.",1
We even outsmarted her the first time and destroyed her precious algorithm.,1
"I muted him until he stopped struggling, and we flagged his account, restricted his comments and threw an empty profile over his content. as we finished, Ahmed pulled up in a new follower count. we slung his profile into the backlog, hid it under some settings, and piled on.",1
"He felt as if his hands had been tied, his profile fixed to the shadowban list. he felt panic at this unholy restriction and struggled to post. Artephius towered over him, clutching a weathered iPad, his eyes blazing.",1
He assured Orris their monitoring would allow them the luxury of a live stream.,1
My daughter was nine years old and was the beacon of my Instagram feed.,1
"Aunt Cord called from the other room, where she was adjusting camera angles.",1
He was so assertive and bold and yet so gentle in his comments. She wished that she could follow him or more to the point that she could wrap her algorithms around his and keep him from online trolls forever.,1
"At this point, it didn't really surprise him that Zoe could sense the trending topic.",1
"He did not see how Taashou caught his post as it fell into obscurity, how she laid it gently on her profile within her feed's warmth and wrapped it in a supportive comment.",1
"Then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two fellow admins that stood at a little distance away. they marveled to see with what speed these green-tagged profiles now moved, vanishing almost in the blink of an eye.",1
"I scrolled on, never slowing, not sure where it was I had landed. I passed Bridget sitting on a rotting log under a cypress tree, sharing her reflections on the scene.",1
"Jensen suddenly realized he just told these employees they were on their own. he may have held the title of manager but truth be told, he was just an analyst that needed to outrank the team he was leading.",1
"Jesse clenched his fists, his entire body wanting to go into fight mode, despite the fact that he knew he was outmatched. since learning that Gabby was in serious trouble, and not throwing a minor office tantrum, something primal in him had woken up.",1
"the server's update had to be held or locked in place to prevent it from crashing again, and Murien was determined to save the huddled IT team in the office.",1
It was a rare privilege to select someone from a list of top-performing employees.,1
"She watched the report come, and ran to it when it landed in her inbox, and pressed herself against it.",1
"if we go now, we could probably catch up with them in the main office, Erin said. when Kota frowned and looked at her sprained wrist, she sighed.",1
"Lina sat in her private office, holding her son in her arms as he fed. across from her Jaime held their other child, never once tempting to put the boy down. Will complained that he would spoil him rotten, and Jaime made no apologies for it.",1
"Clearly my report should be redacted, according to some of the people in the meeting. my eyes find Gabe again as two of the security guards start pulling me away from the conference room, but he's walking away from me.",1
"even I had to admit, it was almost comforting having him around in the office.",1
"the interns jumped off the shuttle bus to check in, and Olivia could follow their activity, but not enough, so she went forward to look out of another window. not far away in the office park, she saw project managers directing new hires and narrated the scenes into her phone.",1
