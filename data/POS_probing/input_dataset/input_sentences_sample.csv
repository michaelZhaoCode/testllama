"A form of asbestos once used * * to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed * to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported 0 *T*-1 ."
"The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that *T*-1 show up decades later , researchers said 0 *T*-2 ."
"Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that *T*-2 makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 ."
"Although preliminary findings were reported *-2 more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely * to bring new attention to the problem ."
"A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story ."
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who *T*-3 studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
"`` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said *T*-1 James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ."
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
The Lorillard spokeswoman said 0 asbestos was used *-1 in `` very modest amounts '' in * making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced *-1 with a different type of filter in 1956 .
"From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold *-3 , the company said 0 *T*-1 ."
"Among 33 men who *T*-4 worked closely with the substance , 28 *ICH*-1 have died -- more than three times the expected number ."
"Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer ."
"The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than * expected *?* , the researchers said 0 *T*-1 ."
"`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who *T*-5 study asbestos-related diseases , '' said *T*-1 Dr. Talcott ."
"The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears *-1 to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied * in Western industrialized countries , he said 0 *T*-2 ."
"The plant , which *T*-1 is owned *-4 by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract *ICH*-2 with Lorillard * to make the cigarette filters ."
"The finding probably will support those who *T*-6 argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found * in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said 0 *T*-1 ."
"The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that *T*-7 does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that *T*-1 are classified *-5 as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine ."
"More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected *-1 by the body , Dr. Mossman explained 0 *T*-2 ."
"In July , the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos ."
"By 1997 , almost all remaining uses of cancer-causing asbestos will be outlawed *-6 ."
About 160 workers at a factory that *T*-8 made paper for the Kent filters were exposed *-7 to asbestos in the 1950s .
Areas of the factory *ICH*-2 were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used *-8 *T*-1 .
"Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used * * to make filters ."
"Workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that *T*-1 hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area ."
"`` There 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos-related diseases , '' said *T*-1 Darrell Phillips , vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose ."
`` But you have *-1 to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago .
It has no bearing on our work force today .
"Yields on money-market mutual funds continued *-1 to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates ."
The average seven-day compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked * by IBC 's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 8.45 % from 8.47 % for the week ended Tuesday .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year .
"Average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days , the longest since early August , according to Donoghue 's ."
Longer maturities are thought *-1 to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
Shorter maturities are considered *-9 a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
"The average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some * to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 33 days ."
"Nevertheless , said *T*-1 Brenda Malizia Negus , editor of Money Fund Report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short-term interest rates ."
"The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold * at Monday 's auction , for example , rose to 8.04 % from 7.90 % ."
"Despite recent declines in yields , investors continue *-1 to pour cash into money funds ."
"Assets of the 400 taxable funds grew by $ 1.5 billion *U* during the latest week , to $ 352.7 billion *U* ."
"Typically , money-fund yields beat comparable short-term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates ."
The top money funds are currently yielding well over 9 % .
"Dreyfus World-Wide Dollar , the top-yielding fund , had a seven-day compound yield of 9.37 % during the latest week , down from 9.45 % a week earlier ."
"It invests heavily in dollar-denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which *T*-9 boosts its yield ."
"The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds was 8.12 % , down from 8.14 % ."
The 30-day simple yield fell to an average 8.19 % from 8.22 % ; the 30-day compound yield slid to an average 8.53 % from 8.56 % .

"The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan 0 the magazine has offered advertisers *T*-1 in three years ."
"Plans that *T*-13 give advertisers discounts for * maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc. 's Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman 's U.S. News & World Report ."
"Alan Spoon , recently named * Newsweek president , said 0 Newsweek 's ad rates would increase 5 % in January ."
"A full , four-color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 *U* ."
"In mid-October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while *-1 not increasing ad page rates ; with a lower circulation base , Time 's ad rate *ICH*-2 will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber ; a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 *U* ."
U.S. News has yet *-1 to announce its 1990 ad rates .
"Newsweek said 0 it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which *T*-1 awards space credits *ICH*-2 to advertisers on `` renewal advertising . ''"
"The magazine will reward with `` page bonuses '' advertisers who in 1990 *T*-1 meet or exceed their 1989 spending , as long as they spent $ 325,000 *U* in 1989 and $ 340,000 *U* in 1990 ."
"Mr. Spoon said 0 the plan is not an attempt * to shore up a decline in ad pages in the first nine months of 1989 ; Newsweek 's ad pages totaled 1,620 , a drop of 3.2 % from last year , according to Publishers Information Bureau ."

"New England Electric System bowed out of the bidding for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire , *-1 saying that the risks were too high *RNR*-4 and the potential payoff too far in the future *RNR*-4 * to justify a higher offer ."
"The move leaves United Illuminating Co. and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire , which *T*-1 also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company *T*-2 ."
"New England Electric , based * in Westborough , Mass. , had offered $ 2 billion *U* *ICH*-1 *-4 to acquire PS of New Hampshire , well below the $ 2.29 billion *U* value 0 United Illuminating places *T*-2 on its bid and the $ 2.25 billion *U* 0 Northeast says 0 its bid is worth *T*-3 ."
"United Illuminating is based *-13 in New Haven , Conn. , and Northeast is based *-14 in Hartford , Conn ."
"PS of New Hampshire , Manchester , N.H. , values its internal reorganization plan at about $ 2.2 billion *U* ."
"John Rowe , president *RNR*-1 and chief executive officer *RNR*-1 of New England Electric , said 0 the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related * to PS of New Hampshire -- such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies -- did n't come true ."
"`` When we evaluated *-2 raising our bid *T*-1 , the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years , and the rewards seemed a long way out ."
"That got hard 0 * to take *T*-1 , '' he added *T*-2 ."
Mr. Rowe also noted that political concerns also worried New England Electric .
"No matter who *T*-16 owns PS of New Hampshire , after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation , he said 0 *T*-1 ."
`` That attracts attention ...
"it was just another one of the risk factors '' that *T*-17 led to the company 's decision * to withdraw from the bidding , he added 0 *T*-1 ."
"Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc. , the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders , said 0 the withdrawal of New England Electric might speed up the reorganization process ."
"The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases -- 4.8 % *U* over seven years against around 5.5 % boosts proposed * by the other two outside bidders -- complicated negotiations with state officials , Mr. Ross asserted 0 *T*-1 ."
"`` Now the field is less cluttered , '' he added *T*-1 ."
"Separately , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission turned down for now a request by Northeast seeking approval of its possible purchase of PS of New Hampshire ."

Commonwealth Edison Co. was ordered *-1 *-2 to refund about $ 250 million *U* to its current and former ratepayers for illegal rates collected * for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant .
The refund was about $ 55 million *U* more than * previously ordered *-1 by the Illinois Commerce Commission and trade groups said 0 it may be the largest ever required * of a state or local utility .
"State court Judge Richard Curry ordered Edison *-1 to make average refunds of about $ 45 to $ 50 *U* each to Edison customers who *T*-18 have received electric service since April 1986 , including about two million customers who *T*-19 have moved during that period ."
Judge Curry ordered the refunds *-1 to begin Feb. 1 and said that he would n't entertain any appeals or other attempts * to block his order by Commonwealth Edison .
"`` The refund pool ... may not be held *-1 hostage through another round of appeals , '' Judge Curry said *T*-2 ."
Commonwealth Edison said 0 it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering *-1 appealing Judge Curry 's order .
The exact amount of the refund will be determined *-16 next year based on actual collections made * until Dec. 31 of this year .
Commonwealth Edison said 0 the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by $ 1.55 *U* a share .
"For 1988 , Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of $ 737.5 million *U* , or $ 3.01 *U* a share ."
A Commonwealth Edison spokesman said that * tracking down the two million customers whose addresses *T*-20 have changed during the past 3 1\/2 years would be `` an administrative nightmare . ''
"In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Commonwealth Edison closed at $ 38.375 *U* , down 12.5 cents ."
"The $ 2.5 billion *U* Byron 1 plant near Rockford , Ill. , was completed *-17 in 1985 ."
"In a disputed 1985 ruling , the Commerce Commission said 0 Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by $ 49 million *U* *-1 to pay for the plant ."
But state courts upheld a challenge by consumer groups to the commission 's rate increase and found the rates illegal .
The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission *-1 to audit Commonwealth Edison 's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses .
The utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its 3.1 million customers subject to a refund since 1986 .
"In August , the commission ruled that between $ 190 million and $ 195 million *U* of the plant 's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded *-1 , plus interest ."
"In his ruling , Judge Curry added an additional $ 55 million *U* to the commission 's calculations ."
"Last month , Judge Curry set the interest rate on the refund at 9 % ."
Commonwealth Edison now faces an additional court-ordered refund on its summer\/winter rate differential collections that the Illinois Appellate Court has estimated *T*-1 at $ 140 million *U* .
And consumer groups hope that Judge Curry 's Byron 1 order may set a precedent for a second nuclear rate case involving Commonwealth Edison 's Braidwood 2 plant .
Commonwealth Edison is seeking about $ 245 million *U* in rate increases 0 *T*-1 to pay for Braidwood 2 .
The commission is expected *-1 to rule on the Braidwood 2 case by year end .
Last year Commonwealth Edison had *-1 to refund $ 72.7 million *U* for poor performance of its LaSalle I nuclear plant .
"Japan 's domestic sales of cars , trucks and buses in October rose 18 % from a year earlier to 500,004 units , a record for the month , the Japan Automobile Dealers ' Association said 0 *T*-1 ."

"The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears *-1 to depend heavily on the creativity -- and longevity -- of its chairman and chief designer , Seymour Cray ."
"Not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied *-1 directly to Mr. Cray , so is *T*-2 its balance sheet ."
Documents filed * with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc. will withdraw the almost $ 100 million *U* in financing 0 it is providing the new firm *T*-1 if Mr. Cray leaves or if the product-design project 0 he heads *T*-2 is scrapped *-18 .
"The documents also said that although the 64-year-old Mr. Cray has been working on the project for more than six years , the Cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype ."
"Moreover , there have been no orders for the Cray-3 so far , though the company says 0 it is talking with several prospects ."
"While many of the risks were anticipated *-19 when Minneapolis-based Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May *T*-1 , the strings 0 it attached *T*-2 to the financing had n't been made *-3 public until yesterday ."
"`` We did n't have much of a choice , '' Cray Computer 's chief financial officer , Gregory Barnum , said *T*-1 in an interview ."
"`` The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 , and without him it could not be completed *-20 ."
Cray Research did not want *-1 to fund a project that *T*-22 did not include Seymour . ''
The documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates *-1 needing perhaps another $ 120 million *U* in financing beginning next September .
But Mr. Barnum called that `` a worst-case '' scenario .
The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump $ 2.875 *U* yesterday *-1 to close at $ 38 *U* in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research 's decision * to link its $ 98.3 million *U* promissory note to Mr. Cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company .
"`` It has *-2 to be considered *-21 as an additional risk for the investor , '' said *T*-1 Gary P. Smaby of Smaby Group Inc. , Minneapolis ."
"`` Cray Computer will be a concept stock , '' he said *T*-1 ."
`` You either believe 0 Seymour can do it again or you do n't *?* . ''
"Besides the designer 's age , other risk factors for Mr. Cray 's new company include the Cray-3 's tricky , unproven chip technology ."
"The SEC documents describe those chips , which *T*-1 are made *-22 of gallium arsenide , as *-2 being so fragile and minute 0 they will require special robotic handling equipment ."
"In addition , the Cray-3 will contain 16 processors -- twice as many as the largest current supercomputer ."
"Cray Computer also will face intense competition , not only from Cray Research , which *T*-23 has about 60 % of the world-wide supercomputer market and which *T*-24 is expected *-1 to roll out the C-90 machine , a direct competitor with the Cray-3 , in 1991 ."
"The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan 's Big Three -- Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd ."
The new company said 0 it believes 0 there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced * between $ 15 million and $ 30 million *U* -- presumably the Cray-3 price range .
"Under terms of the spinoff , Cray Research stockholders are *-1 to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares 0 they own *T*-2 in a distribution expected * to occur in about two weeks ."
No price for the new shares has been set *-23 .
"Instead , the companies will leave it up to the marketplace * to decide ."
Cray Computer has applied *-1 to trade on Nasdaq .
Analysts calculate Cray Computer 's initial book value at about $ 4.75 *U* a share .
"Along with the note , Cray Research is transferring about $ 53 million *U* in assets , primarily those related to the Cray-3 development , which *T*-25 has been a drain on Cray Research 's earnings ."
Pro-forma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff *T*-1 .
"Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able *-2 to report a profit of $ 19.3 million *U* *ICH*-3 for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million *U* 0 it posted *T*-1 ."
"On the other hand , had it existed then , Cray Computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million *U* loss ."
"Mr. Cray , who *T*-1 could n't be reached *-24 for comment , will work for the new Colorado Springs , Colo. , company as an independent contractor -- the arrangement 0 he had *T*-2 with Cray Research ."
"*-25 Regarded *-1 as the father of the supercomputer , Mr. Cray was paid *-25 $ 600,000 *U* at Cray Research last year ."
"At Cray Computer , he will be paid *-26 $ 240,000 *U* ."
"Besides Messrs. Cray and Barnum , other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport , 47 , president and chief executive officer ; Joseph M. Blanchard , 37 , vice president , engineering ; Malcolm A. Hammerton , 40 , vice president , software ; and Douglas R. Wheeland , 45 , vice president , hardware ."
All came from Cray Research .
"Cray Computer , which *T*-26 currently employs 241 people , said 0 it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990 ."
"John R. Stevens , 49 years old , was named *-27 senior executive vice president and chief operating officer , both new positions ."
"He will continue *-1 to report to Donald Pardus , president and chief executive officer ."
Mr. Stevens was executive vice president of this electric-utility holding company .
"Arthur A. Hatch , 59 , was named *-28 executive vice president of the company ."
He was previously president of the company 's Eastern Edison Co. unit .

"The U.S. , *-1 claiming some success in its trade diplomacy , removed South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia from a list of countries 0 it is closely watching *T*-2 for * allegedly failing *-3 to honor U.S. patents , copyrights and other intellectual-property rights ."
"However , five other countries -- China , Thailand , India , Brazil and Mexico -- will remain on that so-called priority watch list as a result of an interim review , U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced 0 *T*-1 ."
"Under the new U.S. trade law , those countries could face accelerated unfair-trade investigations and stiff trade sanctions if they do n't improve their protection of intellectual property by next spring ."
Mrs. Hills said 0 many of the 25 countries that she placed *T*-1 under varying degrees of scrutiny have made `` genuine progress '' on this touchy issue .
"She said 0 there is `` growing realization *ICH*-1 '' around the world that denial of intellectual-property rights harms all trading nations , and particularly the `` creativity and inventiveness of an -LCB- offending -RCB- country 's own citizens . ''"
U.S. trade negotiators argue that countries with inadequate protections for intellectual-property rights could be hurting themselves by *-1 discouraging their own scientists and authors and by *-1 deterring U.S. high-technology firms from *-2 investing or marketing their best products there .
Mrs. Hills lauded South Korea for *-1 creating an intellectual-property task force and special enforcement teams of police officers and prosecutors trained * to pursue movie and book pirates .
"Seoul also has instituted effective search-and-seizure procedures 0 * to aid these teams *T*-2 , she said 0 *T*-1 ."
"Taiwan has improved its standing with the U.S. by *-2 initialing a bilateral copyright agreement , amending its trademark law and introducing legislation 0 * to protect foreign movie producers from unauthorized showings of their films *T*-1 ."
That measure could compel Taipei 's growing number of small video-viewing parlors to pay movie producers for * showing their films .
"Saudi Arabia , for its part , has vowed *-2 to enact a copyright law compatible with international standards and *-2 to apply the law to computer software as well as to literary works , Mrs. Hills said 0 *T*-1 ."
"These three countries are n't completely off the hook , though ."
They will remain on a lower-priority list that *T*-27 includes 17 other countries .
"Those countries -- including Japan , Italy , Canada , Greece and Spain -- are still of some concern to the U.S. but are deemed *-1 to pose less-serious problems for American patent and copyright owners than those on the `` priority '' list ."
"Gary Hoffman , a Washington lawyer specializing in intellectual-property cases , said 0 the threat of U.S. retaliation , combined * with a growing recognition that * protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest , prompted the improvements made * by South Korea , Taiwan and Saudi Arabia ."

"She did n't elaborate , although earlier U.S. trade reports have complained of videocassette piracy in Malaysia and disregard for U.S. pharmaceutical patents in Turkey ."
The 1988 trade act requires Mrs. Hills to issue another review of the performance of these countries by April 30 .

Argentina said 0 it will ask creditor banks *-1 to halve its foreign debt of $ 64 billion *U* -- the third-highest in the developing world .
The declaration by Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli is believed *-1 to be the first time 0 such an action has been called for *-3 by an Argentine official of such stature *T*-2 .
The Latin American nation has paid very little on its debt since early last year .
"`` Argentina aspires *-2 to reach a reduction of 50 % in the value of its external debt , '' Mr. Rapanelli said *T*-1 through his spokesman , Miguel Alurralde ."

THREE COMPUTERS THAT *T*-31 CHANGED the face of personal computing were launched *-32 in 1977 .
"That year the Apple II , Commodore Pet and Tandy TRS-80 came to market ."
The computers were crude by today 's standards .
"Apple II owners , for example , had *-1 to use their television sets as screens and stored data on audiocassettes ."
"But Apple II was a major advance from Apple I , which *T*-1 was built *-33 in a garage by Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs for hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club ."
"In addition , the Apple II was an affordable $ 1,298 *U* ."
"*-1 Crude as they were *?* , these early PCs triggered explosive product development in desktop models for the home and office ."
Big mainframe computers for business had been around for years .
"But the new 1977 PCs -- unlike earlier built-from-kit types such as the Altair , Sol and IMSAI -- had keyboards and could store about two pages of data in their memories ."
Current PCs are more than 50 times faster and have memory capacity 500 times greater than their 1977 counterparts .
There were many pioneer PC contributors .
"William Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 developed an early language-housekeeper system for PCs , and Gates became an industry billionaire six years after IBM adapted one of these versions in 1981 ."
"Alan F. Shugart , currently chairman of Seagate Technology , led the team that *T*-32 developed the disk drives for PCs ."
"Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington , two Atlanta engineers , were co-developers of the internal modems that *T*-33 allow PCs to share data via the telephone ."
"IBM , the world leader in computers , did n't offer its first PC until August 1981 as many other companies entered the market ."
"Today , PC shipments annually total some $ 38.3 billion *U* world-wide ."
"F.H. Faulding & Co. , an Australian pharmaceuticals company , said 0 its Moleculon Inc. affiliate acquired Kalipharma Inc. for $ 23 million *U* ."
Kalipharma is a New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals concern that *T*-34 sells products under the Purepac label .
Faulding said 0 it owns 33 % of Moleculon 's voting stock and has an agreement * to acquire an additional 19 % .
"That stake , together with its convertible preferred stock holdings , gives Faulding the right * to increase its interest to 70 % of Moleculon 's voting stock ."
"Oil production from Australia 's Bass Strait fields will be raised *-34 by 11,000 barrels a day to about 321,000 barrels with the launch of the Whiting field , the first of five small fields scheduled * to be brought *-35 into production before the end of 1990 ."
"Esso Australia Ltd. , a unit of New York-based Exxon Corp. , and Broken Hill Pty. operate the fields in a joint venture ."
Esso said 0 the Whiting field started production Tuesday .
"Output will be gradually increased *-1 until it reaches about 11,000 barrels a day ."
The field has reserves of 21 million barrels .
Reserves for the five new fields total 50 million barrels .
"The Perch and Dolphin fields are expected *-3 to start *-1 producing early next year , and the Seahorse and Tarwhine fields later next year ."
Esso said 0 the fields were developed *-36 after the Australian government decided in 1987 *-2 to make the first 30 million barrels from new fields free of excise tax .
"R.P. Scherer Corp. said 0 it completed the $ 10.2 million *U* sale of its Southern Optical subsidiary to a group led * by the unit 's president , Thomas R. Sloan , and other managers ."
"Following the acquisition of R.P. Scherer by a buy-out group led * by Shearson Lehman Hutton earlier this year , the maker of gelatin capsules decided *-1 to divest itself of certain of its non-encapsulating businesses ."
The sale of Southern Optical is a part of the program .
"The White House said 0 President Bush has approved duty-free treatment for imports of certain types of watches that *T*-35 are n't produced *-1 in `` significant quantities '' in the U.S. , the Virgin Islands and other U.S. possessions ."
The action came in response to a petition filed * by Timex Inc. for changes in the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences for imports from developing nations .
"Previously , watch imports were denied *-37 such duty-free treatment ."
"Timex had requested duty-free treatment for many types of watches , covered * by 58 different U.S. tariff classifications ."
"The White House said 0 Mr. Bush decided *-1 to grant duty-free status for 18 categories , but turned down such treatment for other types of watches `` because of the potential for material injury to watch producers located * in the U.S. and the Virgin Islands . ''"
"Timex is a major U.S. producer and seller of watches , including low-priced battery-operated watches assembled * in the Philippines and other developing nations covered * by the U.S. tariff preferences ."
U.S. trade officials said 0 the Philippines and Thailand would be the main beneficiaries of the president 's action .
"Imports of the types of watches that *T*-36 now will be eligible for duty-free treatment totaled about $ 37.3 million *U* *ICH*-1 in 1988 , a relatively small share of the $ 1.5 billion *U* in U.S. watch imports that year , according to an aide to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills ."
"Magna International Inc. 's chief financial officer , James McAlpine , resigned and its chairman , Frank Stronach , is stepping in *-1 to help turn the automotive-parts manufacturer around , the company said 0 *T*-2 ."
"Mr. Stronach will direct an effort * to reduce overhead and curb capital spending `` until a more satisfactory level of profit is achieved and maintained *-1 , '' Magna said 0 *T*-2 ."
"Stephen Akerfeldt , currently vice president finance , will succeed Mr. McAlpine ."
An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn .
"The company has reported declines in operating profit in each of the past three years , despite steady sales growth ."
Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company 's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52-week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 13.73 *U* -RRB- .
"On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday , Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$ 9.625 *U* ."
"Mr. Stronach , founder and controlling shareholder of Magna , resigned as chief executive officer last year *-1 to seek , unsuccessfully , a seat in Canada 's Parliament ."
Analysts said 0 Mr. Stronach wants *-1 to resume a more influential role in * running the company .
They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization .
"The company said 0 Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring , *-1 assisted *-2 by Manfred Gingl , president and chief executive ."
Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached *-38 for comment .
"Magna said 0 Mr. McAlpine resigned *-1 to pursue a consulting career , with Magna as one of his clients ."

"Japanese investors nearly single-handedly bought up two new mortgage securities-based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million *U* , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said 0 *T*-1 ."
"The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage-based instruments , Fannie Mae 's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said 0 *T*-1 at a news conference ."
He said 0 more than 90 % of the funds were placed *-40 with Japanese institutional investors .
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .
"Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million *U* mortgage-backed securities mutual fund ."
"That fund was put *-41 together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank ."
"The latest two funds were assembled *-42 jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan 's Daiwa Securities Co ."
"The new , seven-year funds -- one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked * to the London interbank offered rate -- offer two key advantages to Japanese investors ."
"First , they are designed *-1 to eliminate the risk of prepayment -- mortgage-backed securities can be retired *-43 early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates ."
"Second , they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments , *-1 reducing the administrative burden on investors ."
"By * addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said 0 *T*-1 , the new funds have become `` extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. . ''"
"Such devices have boosted Japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than 1 % of the $ 900 billion *U* in such instruments outstanding , and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate ."
"They also have become large purchasers of Fannie Mae 's corporate debt , *-2 buying $ 2.4 billion *U* in Fannie Mae bonds during the first nine months of the year , or almost a tenth of the total amount issued * ."
"James L. Pate , 54-year-old executive vice president , was named *-44 a director of this oil concern , * expanding the board to 14 members ."
"LTV Corp. said 0 a federal bankruptcy court judge agreed *-1 to extend until March 8 , 1990 , the period in which the steel , aerospace and energy products company has the exclusive right * to file a reorganization plan *T*-2 ."
"The company is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , * giving it court protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it attempts *-1 to work out a plan * to pay its debts ."
"Italian chemical giant Montedison S.p.A. , through its Montedison Acquisition N.V. indirect unit , began its $ 37-a-share *U* tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of Erbamont N.V. , a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated * in the Netherlands ."
"The offer , advertised * in today 's editions of The Wall Street Journal , is scheduled *-1 to expire at the end of November ."
Montedison currently owns about 72 % of Erbamont 's common shares outstanding .
The offer is being launched *-45 pursuant to a previously announced agreement between the companies .
"Japan 's reserves of gold , convertible foreign currencies , and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ 1.82 billion *U* in October to $ 84.29 billion *U* , the Finance Ministry said 0 *T*-2 ."
The total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline .
"The protracted downturn reflects the intensity of Bank of Japan yen-support intervention since June , when the U.S. currency temporarily surged above the 150.00 yen level *T*-1 ."
The announcement follows a sharper $ 2.2 billion *U* decline in the country 's foreign reserves in September to $ 86.12 billion *U* .
"* Pick a country , any country ."
"It 's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street : a rash of new closed-end country funds , those publicly traded portfolios that *T*-37 invest in stocks of a single foreign country ."
"No fewer than 24 country funds *ICH*-1 have been launched *-2 or registered *-2 with regulators this year , triple the level of all of 1988 , according to Charles E. Simon & Co. , a Washington-based research firm ."
The turf recently has ranged from Chile to Austria to Portugal .
"Next week , the Philippine Fund 's launch will be capped *-46 by a visit by Philippine President Corazon Aquino -- the first time 0 a head of state has kicked off an issue at the Big Board here *T*-1 ."
The next province ?
"`` Anything 's possible -- how about the New Guinea Fund ? '' quips *T*-1 George Foot , a managing partner at Newgate Management Associates of Northampton , Mass ."
"The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the `` closed-end fund mania '' of the 1920s , Mr. Foot says 0 *T*-2 , when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular *T*-1 ."
They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash .
"Unlike traditional open-end mutual funds , most of these one-country portfolios are the `` closed-end '' type , *-1 issuing a fixed number of shares that *T*-38 trade publicly ."
The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that *T*-39 are *RNR*-1 or soon will be *RNR*-1 listed *-2 in New York or London .
These funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets .
"`` People are looking *-1 to stake their claims '' now before the number of available nations runs out , says *T*-2 Michael Porter , an analyst at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , New York ."
Behind all the hoopla is *T*-1 some heavy-duty competition .
"As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years , securities firms have scrambled *-1 to find new products that brokers find *T*-40 easy 0 * to sell *T*-2 ."
And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide *-1 to do it .
Financial planners often urge investors *-1 to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities .
"And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets , such as the U.S. and Japan ."
Country funds offer an easy way 0 * to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of * seeking out individual companies *T*-1 .
But it does n't take much * to get burned *-1 .
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds .
Another concern : The funds ' share prices tend *-1 to swing more than the broader market .
"When the stock market dropped nearly 7 % Oct. 13 *T*-1 , for instance , the Mexico Fund plunged about 18 % and the Spain Fund fell 16 % ."
And most country funds were clobbered *-47 more than most stocks after the 1987 crash .
What *ICH*-1 *T*-41 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios .
"After *-1 trading at an average discount of more than 20 % in late 1987 and part of last year , country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6 % ."
The reason : Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks 0 they hold *T*-1 .
"It 's probably worth * paying a premium for funds that *T*-42 invest in markets that *T*-43 are partially closed to foreign investors , such as South Korea , some specialists say 0 *T*-1 ."
But some European funds recently have skyrocketed ; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 % premium .
It has been targeted *-48 by Japanese investors as a good long-term play tied * to 1992 's European economic integration .
And several new funds that *T*-44 are n't even fully invested yet have jumped *-1 to trade at big premiums .
"`` I 'm very alarmed *-2 to see these rich valuations , '' says *T*-1 Smith Barney 's Mr. Porter ."
"The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds , Mr. Porter suggests 0 *T*-1 ."
"Unlike many U.S. investors , those in Asia or Europe seeking foreign-stock exposure may be less resistant to * paying higher prices for country funds ."
"`` There may be an international viewpoint cast *-2 on the funds listed * here , '' Mr. Porter says *T*-1 ."
"Nonetheless , plenty of U.S. analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds ."
They argue that U.S. investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds ; these so-called ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded * in the U.S. .
That way investors can essentially buy the funds without *-1 paying the premium .
"For people who *T*-45 insist on *-5 jumping in now *-1 to buy the funds , Newgate 's Mr. Foot says : `` The only advice 0 I have *T*-2 for these folks is that those who *T*-3 come to the party late had better *-4 be ready *-4 to leave quickly ."
"The U.S. and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of $ 188 million *U* in pre-Communist Russian debts owed * to the U.S. government , the State Department said 0 *T*-2 ."
"If the debts are repaid *-49 , it could clear the way 0 for Soviet bonds to be sold *-50 in the U.S. *T*-1 ."
"However , after two meetings with the Soviets , a State Department spokesman said that it *EXP*-1 's `` too early * to say '' whether that will happen ."
"Coincident with the talks , the State Department said 0 it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch ."
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved *-1 last spring and opened in July .
"But a Soviet bank here would be crippled *-51 unless Moscow found a way 0 * to settle the $ 188 million *U* debt , which *T*-1 was lent *-52 to the country 's short-lived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917 *T*-2 ."
"Under a 1934 law , the Johnson Debt Default Act , as * amended *-1 , it *EXP*-2 's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the U.S. government , unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ."
The U.S.S.R. belongs to neither organization .
Moscow has settled pre-1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value .
The State Department stressed the pre-1933 debts as the key to * satisfying the Johnson Act .
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to * raising money in the U.S. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lend-lease program .
"In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off , the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed *-1 to rise in September ."
"Meanwhile , the National Association of Purchasing Management said 0 its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month ."
Its index inched up to 47.6 % in October from 46 % in September .
Any reading below 50 % suggests 0 the manufacturing sector is generally declining .
"The purchasing managers , however , also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline ."
"Factories booked $ 236.74 billion *U* in orders *ICH*-1 in September , nearly the same as the $ 236.79 billion *U* in August , the Commerce Department said 0 *T*-2 ."
"If not for a 59.6 % surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors , factory orders would have fallen 2.1 % ."
"In a separate report , the department said 0 construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ 415.6 billion *U* , not significantly different from the $ 415.8 billion *U* reported * for August ."
"Private construction spending was down , but government building activity was up ."
"The figures in both reports were adjusted *-1 * to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns , but were n't adjusted for inflation ."
"Kenneth Mayland , economist for Society Corp. , a Cleveland bank , said 0 demand for exports of factory goods is beginning *-1 to taper off ."
"At the same time , the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed *-1 to revive the residential construction industry ."
`` What sector is *T*-46 stepping forward *-2 to pick up the slack ? '' he asked *T*-1 .
`` I draw a blank . ''
"By most measures , the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly -- if at all ."
Factory payrolls fell in September .
So did *?* *T*-1 the Federal Reserve Board 's industrial-production index .
Yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about *-1 to slip into recession .
They cite a lack of `` imbalances '' that *T*-47 provide early warning signals of a downturn .
"Inventories are closely watched *-1 for such clues , for instance ."
Economists say 0 a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that *T*-48 can lead to a recession .
"But yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said 0 factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 ."
"`` This conforms to the ` soft landing ' scenario , '' said *T*-1 Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp ."
`` I do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive . ''
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that *T*-49 eases inflation without *-1 leading to a recession .
The department said 0 orders for nondurable goods -- those intended * to last fewer than three years -- fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion *U* after *-1 climbing 0.9 % the month before .
Orders for durable goods were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion *U* after *-1 rising 3.9 % the month before .
The department previously estimated that durable-goods orders fell 0.1 % in September .
Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion *U* after * rising 5.4 % in August .
"Shipments have been relatively level since January , the Commerce Department noted 0 *T*-1 ."
"Manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion *U* , *-3 helped *-2 by strength in the defense capital goods sector ."
"Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % ."
"In its construction spending report , the Commerce Department said 0 residential construction , which *T*-50 accounts for nearly half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % *ICH*-3 in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion *U* ."
"David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted 0 the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes , but probably not until early next year ."
"Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion *U* with no sector showing strength ."
Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion *U* .
"After *-1 adjusting for inflation , the Commerce Department said 0 construction spending did n't change in September ."
"For the first nine months of the year , total construction spending ran about 2 % above last year 's level ."
The government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued * earlier in the week by McGraw-Hill Inc. 's F.W. Dodge Group .
Dodge reported an 8 % increase in construction contracts awarded * in September .
The goverment counts money as it is spent *-53 ; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded *-54 *T*-1 .
The government includes money spent * on residential renovation ; Dodge does n't *?* .
"Although the purchasing managers ' index continues *-1 to indicate a slowing economy , it is n't signaling an imminent recession , said 0 *T*-2 Robert Bretz , chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. , Stamford , Conn ."
He said 0 the index would have *-1 to be in the low 40 % range for several months *-1 to be considered *-55 a forecast of recession .
"The report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth , though *-1 still continuing , may be slowing ."
"Only 19 % of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October , down from 27 % in September ."
"And 8 % *ICH*-1 said 0 export orders were down last month , compared with 6 % the month before ."
The purhasing managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control .
"For the fifth consecutive month , purchasing managers said 0 prices for the goods 0 they purchased *T*-1 fell ."
The decline was even steeper than in September .
They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly *ICH*-1 in October than they had *?* for each of the five previous months .
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating .
"When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle *T*-1 and delivery times lengthen *T*-1 , prices tend *-2 to rise ."
The purchasing managers ' report is based *-56 on data provided * by more than 250 purchasing executives .
Each of the survey 's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening .
"For the first time , the October survey polled members on imports ."
"It found that of the 73 % who *T*-51 import , 10 % *T*-1 said 0 they imported more in October and 12 % *T*-1 said 0 they imported less than the previous month ."
"While *-1 acknowledging 0 one month 's figures do n't prove a trend , Mr. Bretz said , `` It does lead you to suspect 0 imports are going down , or at least not increasing that much . ''"
"Items listed * as *-1 being in short supply numbered only about a dozen , but they included one newcomer : milk and milk powder ."
"`` It 's an odd thing 0 * to put *T*-1 on the list , '' Mr. Bretz noted *T*-2 ."
"He said that for the second month in a row , food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk ."
"They blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high U.S. exports of dry milk , coupled * with very low import quotas ."

"* Judging from the Americana in Haruki Murakami 's `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' -LRB- Kodansha , 320 pages , $ 18.95 *U* -RRB- , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common ."

They read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .

This is Japan ?
"For an American reader , part of the charm of this engaging novel should come in * recognizing that Japan is n't the buttoned-down society of contemporary American lore ."
"It *EXP*-1 's also refreshing * to read a Japanese author who *T*-52 clearly does n't belong to the self-aggrandizing `` we-Japanese '' school of writers who *T*-53 perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders ."
"If `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' carries an implicit message for international relations , it 's that the Japanese are more like us than most of us think 0 *?* ."
That 's not * to say that the nutty plot of `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' is rooted *-57 in reality .
It 's imaginative and often funny .
"A disaffected , hard-drinking , nearly-30 hero sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree ."
"He has in tow his prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts *T*-54 mark her as anything but a docile butterfly ."
"Along the way , he meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who *T*-55 offers the hero God 's phone number ; and the Sheep Man , a sweet , roughhewn figure who *T*-56 wears -- what else -- a sheepskin ."
The 40-year-old Mr. Murakami is a publishing sensation in Japan .
"A more recent novel , `` Norwegian Wood '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems *-1 to be fluent in Beatles lyrics -RRB- , has sold more than four million copies since Kodansha published it in 1987 ."
But he is just one of several youthful writers -- Tokyo 's brat pack -- who *T*-57 are dominating the best-seller charts in Japan .
"Their books are written *-1 in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana ."
"In Robert Whiting 's `` You Gotta Have Wa '' -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 *U* -RRB- , the Beatles give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version 0 we would be hard put *-2 to call *T*-1 a `` game . ''"
"As Mr. Whiting describes it , Nipponese baseball is a `` mirror of Japan 's fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''"
`` Wa '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of it .
A player 's commitment to practice and team image is as important as his batting average .
"Polls once named Tokyo Giants star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of Japan ."
"But other than the fact that besuboru is played *-1 with a ball and a bat , it 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; ties are permitted *-2 -- even welcomed *-2 -- since they honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; players must abide by strict rules of conduct even in their personal lives -- players for the Tokyo Giants , for example , must always wear ties when on the road ."
"`` You Gotta Have Wa '' is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed * to two per team , fare *T*-1 in Japan ."

It 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom Sony hosted *T*-58 for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in Tokyo -- to the regret of both parties .
"In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , Mr. Katzenstein describes how Sony invades even the most mundane aspects of its workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned *-59 lunch partners *T*-1 -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run * by a prying caretaker *T*-2 ."
Some of his observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
"It *EXP*-3 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager , and that Sony was chary of *-4 letting a young , short-term American employee take on any responsibility ."
"All of this must have been enormously frustrating to Mr. Katzenstein , who *T*-59 went to Sony with degrees in business and computer science and was raring *-1 to invent another Walkman ."
"But Sony ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired Mr. Katzenstein , after he committed the social crime of * making an appointment * to see the venerable Akio Morita , founder of Sony ."
It *EXP*-1 's a shame 0 their meeting never took place .
"Mr. Katzenstein certainly would have learned something , and it *EXP*-1 's even possible 0 Mr. Morita would have *?* too ."

More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke .
"In Singapore , a new law requires smokers to put out their cigarettes before *-1 entering restaurants , department stores and sports centers or face a $ 250 *U* fine ."
"Discos and private clubs are exempt from the ban , and smoking will be permitted *-60 in bars except during meal hours , an official said 0 *T*-1 ."
"Singapore already bans smoking in all theaters , buses , public elevators , hospitals and fast-food restaurants ."
"In Malaysia , Siti Zaharah Sulaiman , a deputy minister in the prime minister 's office , launched a `` No-Smoking Week '' at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools *-1 to ban on-campus smoking ."
South Korea has different concerns .
"In Seoul , officials began *-1 visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls *-1 to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes ."
South Korea has opened its market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .
A marketing study indicates that Hong Kong consumers are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where the survey was carried out *T*-1 .
"The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency also found that the colony 's consumers feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which *T*-60 include the U.S. and Japan ."
"The survey found that nearly half of Hong Kong consumers espouse what it identified *T*-61 as materialistic values , compared with about one-third in Japan and the U.S. ."
"More than three in five said 0 they are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in Japan ."
The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal * to build a $ 19 million *U* conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now .
"The meeting , which *T*-62 is expected *-1 to draw 20,000 to Bangkok , was going *-2 to be held *-61 at the Central Plaza Hotel , but the government balked at the hotel 's conditions for * undertaking necessary expansion ."
A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built *-62 in such a short time .
"Yasser Arafat has written to the chairman of the International Olympic Committee *-2 asking him *-3 to back a Palestinian bid * to join the committee , the Palestine Liberation Organization news agency WAFA said 0 *T*-1 ."
An official of the Palestinian Olympic Committee said 0 the committee first applied for membership in 1979 and renewed its application in August of this year .
The PLO in recent months has been trying *-1 to join international organizations but failed earlier this year *-1 to win membership in the World Health Organization and the World Tourism Organization .

"Once the disease was confirmed *-63 , all the man 's associates and family were tested *-64 , but none have so far been found *-1 to have AIDS , the newspaper said 0 *T*-2 ."
"The man had for a long time had `` a chaotic sex life , '' including relations with foreign men , the newspaper said 0 *T*-1 ."
The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150 % and doubled gas prices .
The official news agency PAP said 0 the increases were intended *-1 to bring unrealistically low energy charges into line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .
"In happier news , South Korea , in *-1 establishing diplomatic ties with Poland yesterday , announced $ 450 million *U* in loans to the financially strapped Warsaw government ."
"In a victory for environmentalists , Hungary 's parliament terminated a multibillion-dollar River Danube dam being built * by Austrian firms ."
"The Nagymaros dam was designed *-1 *-2 to be twinned *-3 with another dam , now nearly complete , 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia ."
"In *-2 ending Hungary 's part of the project , Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia , which *T*-64 still wants the dam to be built *-1 ."
Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built *-67 as * planned *-2 .
Czechoslovakia said in May 0 it could seek $ 2 billion *U* from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken *-68 .
The Czech dam ca n't be operated *-69 solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project .

"BRAMALEA Ltd. said 0 it agreed *-1 to issue 100 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 85.1 million *U* -RRB- of 10.5 % senior debentures due Nov. 30 , 1999 , together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants ."
"The Toronto-based real estate concern said 0 each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$ 1,000 *U* principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase ."
"The warrants expire Nov. 30 , 1990 ."
The issue will be swapped *-70 into fixed-rate U.S. dollars at a rate 0 the company said 0 *T*-1 is less than 9 % ; a spokesman declined *-2 to elaborate .
"Lead underwriters for the issue are Scotia McLeod Inc. and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. , both Toronto-based investment dealers ."
Bramalea said 0 it expects *-1 to complete the issue by the end of the month .
"As an actor , Charles Lane is n't the inheritor of Charlie Chaplin 's spirit ."
Steve Martin has already laid his claim to that .
"But it is Mr. Lane , as movie director , producer and writer , who *T*-65 has been obsessed with * refitting Chaplin 's Little Tramp in a contemporary way ."
"In 1976 , as a film student at the Purchase campus of the State University of New York , Mr. Lane shot `` A Place in Time , '' a 36-minute black-and-white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets ."
"Now , 13 years later , Mr. Lane has revived his Artist in a full-length movie called * `` Sidewalk Stories , '' a poignant piece of work about a modern-day tramp ."
"Of course , if the film contained dialogue , Mr. Lane 's Artist would be called *-71 a homeless person ."
"So would *?* *T*-1 the Little Tramp , for that matter ."
I say `` * contained dialogue '' because `` Sidewalk Stories '' is n't really silent at all .
"Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr. Lane 's who *T*-66 earns his living *-1 playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that *T*-67 tells you what the characters are thinking *T*-2 and feeling *T*-2 far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would *?* ."
Much of Mr. Lane 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. Chaplin 's notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit -RRB- .
"*-2 Filmed *-1 in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of `` Sidewalk Stories '' seem benign ."
"On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , *-2 noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs *T*-1 ."
"The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated * by jugglers , magicians and other good-natured hustlers ."
"-LRB- This *ICH*-1 clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan , no one curled up in a cardboard box . -RRB-"
The Artist has his routine .
"He spends his days *-1 sketching passers-by , or *-1 trying *-2 to *?* ."
At night he returns to the condemned building 0 he calls *T*-1 home .
"His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree ."
He is his own man .
"Then , just as the Tramp is given *-72 a blind girl 0 * to cure *T*-2 in `` City Lights , '' the Artist is put *-73 in charge of *-73 returning a two-year-old waif -LRB- Nicole Alysia -RRB- , whose father *T*-1 has been murdered *-74 by thugs , to her mother ."
This cute child turns out *-1 to be a blessing and a curse .
"She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life ."
The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has *-1 to tuck a little girl into one of them at night *T*-2 .
"*-1 To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who *T*-68 owns her own children 's shop and who *T*-69 lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building ."
This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does *?* behind it .
Mr. Lane 's final purpose is n't *-1 to glamorize the Artist 's vagabond existence .
"He has a point 0 he wants *-1 to make *T*-2 , and he makes it , with a great deal of force ."
"The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices ."
The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his `` Story of Women . ''
"He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that *T*-70 's captivating -- about a character who , *-2 viewed *-3 from the most sympathetic angle , *T*-1 would seem disagreeable ."
"Yet this woman , Marie-Louise Giraud , carries historical significance , both as one of the last women 0 *T*-1 to be executed *-2 in France and as a symbol of the Vichy government 's hypocrisy ."
"While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor ."
"Marie-Louise , a small-time abortionist , was their woman ."
"She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war-rationed goodies ."
"She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client ."
Her remorse was shallow and brief .
"Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home ."
"As * presented *-1 by Mr. Chabrol , and played *-1 with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , Marie-Louise -LRB- called * Marie Latour in the film -RRB- was not a nice person ."
But she did n't deserve *-1 to have her head chopped *-2 off .
"There is very little 0 *T*-1 to recommend `` Old Gringo , '' a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution ."
Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking *-1 to celebrate victory .
"I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who *T*-71 wants *-1 to die the way 0 he wants *-2 to die *T*-3 ."
"Video Tip : Before *-1 seeing `` Sidewalk Stories , '' * take a look at `` City Lights , '' Chaplin 's Tramp at his finest ."
Boeing Co. said 0 it is discussing plans *ICH*-1 with three of its regular Japanese suppliers * to possibly help *-2 build a larger version of its popular 767 twin-jet .
"The discussions are still in preliminary stages , and the specific details have n't been worked *-2 out between the Seattle aerospace company and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd ."
"The three Japanese companies build the body sections of the 767 , *-1 accounting for a combined 15 % of the aircraft ."
Japanese press reports have speculated that the Japanese contribution could rise to between 20 % and 25 % *U* under the new program .
"If Boeing goes ahead with the larger 767 , the plane could hit the market in the mid-1990s ."
"This is the year 0 the negative ad , for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns , became the main event *T*-1 ."
"The irony is that the attack commercial , after *-1 getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign , has come of age in an off-off election year with only a few contests scattered * across the country ."
"But in the three leading political contests of 1989 , the negative ads have reached new levels of hostility , *-1 raising fears that this kind of mudslinging , empty of significant issues , is ushering in a new era of campaigns without content ."
"`` Now , '' says *T*-1 Joseph Napolitan , a pioneer in political television , `` the idea is * to attack first , last and always . ''"
"A trend that *T*-72 started with the first stirrings of politics , accelerated with the dawn of the television age and became a sometimes-tawdry art form in 1988 , has reached an entirely new stage ."
"`` *-1 To get people 's attention these days , '' says *T*-2 Douglas Bailey , a political consultant , `` your TV ad needs *-1 to be bold and entertaining , and , more often than not , that means confrontational ."
"And , unlike a few years ago , you do n't even have *-1 to worry whether the ad is truthful . ''"
"In 1989 , as often as not , the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted *-1 by the ads themselves ."
"* Take a look , then , at the main attack commercials that *T*-73 set the tone for Tuesday 's elections in New York City , New Jersey and Virginia :"
New York City :
"The screen fills with a small , tight facial shot of David Dinkins , Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City ."
"`` David Dinkins failed *-2 to file his income taxes for four straight years , '' says *T*-1 a disembodied male voice ."
"And then this television commercial , paid for * by Republican Rudolph Giuliani 's campaign and produced * by Roger Ailes , the master of negative TV ads , really gets down to business ."
"Mr. Dinkins , the ad charges 0 *T*-2 , also failed *-1 to report his campaign contributions accurately , hid his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted kidnapper `` through a phony organization with no members , no receipts and no office . ''"
"`` David Dinkins , '' says *T*-2 the kicker , `` Why does he always wait until he 's caught *-1 ? ''"
"`` Nasty innuendoes , '' says *-2 John Siegal , Mr. Dinkins 's issues director , `` designed * *-1 to prosecute a case of political corruption that *T*-74 simply does n't exist . ''"
"*-2 Stung *-1 by the Giuliani ads , Mr. Dinkins 's TV consultants , Robert Shrum and David Doak , finally unleashed a negative ad of their own ."
"The screen shows two distorted , unrecognizable photos , presumably of two politicians ."
"`` * Compare two candidates for mayor , '' says *T*-1 the announcer ."
`` One says 0 he 's for * banning cop-killer bullets .
The other has opposed a ban on cop-killer bullets .
One claims 0 he 's pro-choice .
The other has opposed a woman 's right * to choose . ''
"`` Funny thing , '' says *T*-1 the kicker , `` both these candidates are named *-2 Rudolph Giuliani . ''"
Who 's *T*-1 telling the truth ?
Everybody -- and nobody .
It 's a classic situation of ads that *T*-75 are true but not always fully accurate .
"Mr. Dinkins did fail *-1 to file his income taxes for four years , but he insists 0 he voluntarily admitted the `` oversight '' when he was being considered *-2 for a city job *T*-3 ."
"He was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems , but he insists 0 he made no secret of it ."
"The city 's Campaign Finance Board has refused *-1 to pay Mr. Dinkins $ 95,142 *U* in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete ."
The campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors .
"And , says 0 *T*-1 Mr. Dinkins , he did n't know 0 the man 0 his campaign paid *T*-2 for a get-out-the-vote effort had been convicted *-3 of kidnapping ."
"But , say 0 *T*-1 Mr. Dinkins 's managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members ."
"Mr. Giuliani 's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says 0 the Dinkins ad is `` deceptive . ''"
"The other side , he argues 0 *T*-1 , `` knows 0 Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations ."
"They know 0 he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation . ''"
Virginia :
Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced * by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree 0 *T*-1 was a tour de force .
"Against a shot of Monticello superimposed * on an American flag , an announcer talks about the `` strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty '' that Virginians have nurtured *T*-1 for generations ."
"Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : `` On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants *-1 to take away your right * to choose and *-1 give it to the politicians . ''"
"That commercial -- which *T*-76 said 0 Mr. Coleman wanted *-1 to take away the right of abortion `` even in cases of rape and incest , '' a charge 0 Mr. Coleman denies *T*-2 -- changed the dynamics of the campaign , *-3 transforming it , at least in part , into a referendum on abortion ."
"The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created * by Bob Goodman and designed * *-2 to shake Mr. Wilder 's support among the very women who *T*-77 were attracted *-1 by the abortion ad ."
The Coleman counterattack featured a close-up of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
"A voice says , `` C'mon , now , do n't you have boyfriends ? ''"
Then an announcer interjects : `` It was Douglas Wilder who *T*-78 introduced a bill 0 *T*-1 to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated *-2 about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
"So the next time 0 Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women *T*-1 , * ask him about this law 0 he tried *-3 to pass *T*-2 . ''"
"Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used * by lawmakers ."
"The legislation itself noted that it was introduced *-1 `` by request , '' and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill 0 *T*-2 to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation ."
"`` People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of * being a negative campaigner , '' says *T*-1 Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College ."
`` Wilder has managed *-1 to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything *-2 to get elected *-3 governor and -- more important -- has been able *-1 to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman . ''
"Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours ."
"By Tuesday night , television stations were carrying new ads featuring Mr. Coleman himself raising questions about Mr. Wilder 's sensitivity to rape victims ."
New Jersey :
"The attacks began when Democratic Rep. James Florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of Pinocchio and a photograph of Mr. Florio 's rival , Republican Rep. Jim Courter ."
`` * Remember Pinocchio ? '' says *T*-1 a female voice .
`` * Consider Jim Courter . ''
"And then this commercial , produced * by Bob Squier , gets down to its own mean and dirty business ."
"Pictures of rusted oil drums swim into focus , and the female voice purrs , `` That hazardous waste on his -LCB- Mr. Courter 's -RCB- property -- the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud . ''"
And the nose on Mr. Courter 's face grows .
"The only fraud involved , cry *T*-1 Mr. Courter 's partisans , is the Florio commercial itself , and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial , produced * by Mr. Ailes ."
"In this one , the screen fills with photographs of both candidates ."
`` Who *T*-1 's really lying ? '' asks *T*-2 a female voice .
"`` Florio 's lying , '' the voice goes on , because `` the barrel on Courter 's land ... contained heating oil , was cleaned *-1 up and caused no pollution . ''"
Mr. Courter 's long nose shrinks while Mr. Florio 's grows .
Who *T*-1 's telling the truth ?
"Stephen Salmore , a political scientist at New Jersey 's Eagleton Institute , says 0 it 's another example of an ad that *T*-1 's true but not fully accurate ."
"Barrels were dumped *-1 on the Courter property , a complaint was made *-2 , but there is no evidence 0 the barrels were a serious threat to the environment ."
"Even so , according to Mr. Salmore , the ad was `` devastating '' because it raised questions about Mr. Courter 's credibility ."
But it 's building on a long tradition .
"In 1966 , on route to a re-election rout of Democrat Frank O'Connor , GOP Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York appeared in person *-1 saying , `` If you want *-2 to keep the crime rates high , O'Connor is your man . ''"
"A seat on the Chicago Board of Trade was sold *-1 for $ 350,000 *U* , down $ 16,000 *U* from the previous sale last Friday ."
"Seats currently are quoted *-1 at $ 331,000 *U* , bid * , and $ 350,000 *U* , asked * ."
"The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $ 550,000 *U* , *-2 set *-1 Aug. 31 , 1987 ."
Japanese investment in Southeast Asia is propelling the region toward economic integration .
Interviews with analysts and business people in the U.S. suggest that Japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that Southeast Asian politicians have pursued *T*-2 in fits and starts for decades .
But Japan 's power in the region also is sparking fears of domination and posing fresh policy questions .
"The flow of Japanese funds has set in motion `` a process whereby these economies will be knitted *-1 together by the great Japanese investment machine *T*-2 , '' says 0 *T*-3 Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Corp ."
"In the past five years , Japanese companies have tripled their commitments in Asia to $ 5.57 billion *U* ."
"In Thailand , for example , the government 's Board of Investment approved $ 705.6 million *U* of Japanese investment *ICH*-1 in 1988 , 10 times the U.S. investment figure for the year ."
Japan 's commitment in Southeast Asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade .
Asia 's other cash-rich countries are following Japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region .
"In Taiwan and South Korea , rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for labor-intensive production ."
"These nations , known * as Asia 's `` little tigers , '' also are contributing to Southeast Asia 's integration , but their influence will remain subordinate to Japan 's ."
"For recipient countries such as Thailand and Malaysia , the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth ."
But Asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by Japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of * falling under Japanese economic hegemony now .
"Because of budget constraints in Washington , the U.S. encourages Japan to share economic burdens in the region ."
But it resists *-1 yielding political ground .
"In the coming decade , analysts say 0 *T*-2 , U.S.-Japanese relations will be tested *-1 as Tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic behemoth ."
Japan 's swelling investment in Southeast Asia is part of its economic evolution .
"In the past decade , Japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export ."
"In the 1990s , *-2 spurred *-1 by rising labor costs and the strong yen , these companies will increasingly turn themselves into multinationals with plants around the world ."
"*-1 To capture the investment , Southeast Asian nations will move *-1 to accommodate Japanese business ."
"These nations ' internal decisions `` will be made *-3 in a way 0 * not to offend their largest aid donor , largest private investor and largest lender *T*-1 , '' says 0 *T*-2 Richard Drobnick , director of the international business and research program at the University of Southern California 's Graduate School of Business ."
Japanese money will help *-1 turn Southeast Asia into a more cohesive economic region .
"But , analysts say 0 *T*-2 , Asian cooperation is n't likely *-1 to parallel the European Common Market approach ."
"Rather , Japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors , says 0 *T*-1 Kent Calder , a specialist in East Asian economies at the Woodrow Wilson School for Public and Internatonal Affairs at Princeton University ."
"In electronics , for example , a Japanese company might make television picture tubes in Japan , assemble the sets in Malaysia and export them to Indonesia ."
"`` The effect will be * to pull Asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone , '' says 0 *T*-1 Goldman Sachs 's Mr. Hormats ."
Countries in the region also are beginning *-1 to consider a framework for closer economic and political ties .
The economic and foreign ministers of 12 Asian and Pacific nations will meet in Australia next week *-1 to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications .
"Participants will include the U.S. , Australia , Canada , Japan , South Korea and New Zealand as well as the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , the Philippines and Brunei ."
"In addition , the U.S. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the Pacific rim in a major speech by Secretary of State James Baker , following up a proposal made * in January by Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke ."
The Baker proposal reasserts Washington 's intention * to continue *-1 playing a leading political role in the region .
"`` In Asia , as in Europe , a new order is taking shape , '' Mr. Baker said 0 *T*-1 ."
"`` The U.S. , with its regional friends , must play a crucial role in * designing its architecture . ''"
But * maintaining U.S. influence will be difficult in the face of Japanese dominance in the region .
Japan not only outstrips the U.S. in investment flows but also outranks it in trade with most Southeast Asian countries -LRB- although the U.S. remains the leading trade partner for all of Asia -RRB- .
"Moreover , the Japanese government , now the world 's largest aid donor , is pumping far more assistance *ICH*-2 into the region than the U.S. is *?* ."
"While U.S. officials voice optimism about Japan 's enlarged role in Asia , they also convey an undertone of caution ."
"`` There 's an understanding *ICH*-1 on the part of the U.S. that Japan has *-2 to expand its functions '' in Asia , says 0 *T*-3 J. Michael Farren , undersecretary of commerce for trade ."
"`` If they approach it with a benevolent , altruistic attitude , there will be a net gain for everyone . ''"
Some Asian nations are apprehensive about Washington 's demand that Tokyo step up its military spending *-1 to ease the U.S. security burden in the region .
The issue is further complicated *-1 by uncertainty over the future of the U.S. 's leases on military bases in the Philippines and by a possible U.S. troop reduction in South Korea .
Many Asians regard a U.S. presence as a desirable counterweight to Japanese influence .
"`` No one wants the U.S. to pick up its marbles and go home , '' Mr. Hormats says *T*-1 ."
"For their part , Taiwan and South Korea are expected *-1 to step up their own investments in the next decade *-2 to try *-3 to slow the Japanese juggernaut ."
"`` They do n't want Japan to monopolize the region and sew it up , '' says *T*-1 Chong-sik Lee , professor of East Asian politics at the University of Pennsylvania ."
Cathryn Rice could hardly believe her eyes .
"While *-1 giving the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills to ninth graders at Greenville High School last March 16 , she spotted a student looking at crib sheets ."
"She had seen cheating before , but these notes were uncanny ."
`` A stockbroker is an example of a profession in trade and finance ... .
"At the end of World War II , Germany surrendered before Japan ... ."
The Senate-House conference committee is used *-1 when a bill is passed *-3 by the House and Senate in different forms *T*-2 . ''
"Virtually word for word , the notes matched questions and answers on the social-studies section of the test 0 the student was taking *T*-1 ."
"In fact , the student had the answers to almost all of the 40 questions in that section ."
"The student surrendered the notes , but not without a protest ."
"`` My teacher said 0 it *EXP*-1 was OK for me to use the notes on the test , '' he said *T*-2 ."
The teacher in question was Nancy Yeargin -- considered by many students and parents * to be one of the best at the school .
"*-2 Confronted *-1 , Mrs. Yeargin admitted 0 she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two low-ability geography classes ."
She had gone so far as *-1 to display the questions on an overhead projector and underline the answers .
Mrs. Yeargin was fired *-1 and prosecuted *-1 under an unusual South Carolina law that *T*-79 makes it *EXP*-2 a crime * to breach test security .
"In September , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 *U* fine ."
Her alternative was 90 days in jail .
Her story is partly one of personal downfall .
"She was an unstinting teacher who *T*-80 won laurels and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again ."
"In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who *T*-81 was her friend and now calls her a betrayer ; of colleagues who *T*-82 say 0 she brought them shame ; of students and parents who *T*-83 defended her and insist 0 she was treated *-1 harshly ; and of school-district officials stunned that despite the bald-faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr ."
"Mrs. Yeargin 's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing *T*-1 and where high-stakes testing has enhanced the temptation * to cheat *T*-2 ."
The 1987 statute 0 Mrs. Yeargin violated *T*-1 was designed *-2 *-3 to enforce provisions of South Carolina 's school-improvement laws .
Prosecutors alleged that she was trying *-1 to bolster students ' scores *-1 to win a bonus under the state 's 1984 Education Improvement Act .
The bonus depended on her ability * to produce higher student-test scores .
"`` There is incredible pressure *ICH*-2 on school systems and teachers * to raise test scores , '' says *T*-1 Walt Haney , an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College ."
`` So efforts * to beat the tests are also on the rise . ''
"And *-1 most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who *T*-84 are blamed *-2 for much of the wrongdoing ."
"A 50-state study released * in September by Friends for Education , an Albuquerque , N.M. , school-research group , concluded that `` outright cheating by American educators '' is `` common . ''"
"The group says 0 standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often `` teach the test '' as Mrs. Yeargin did *?* , although most are never caught *-1 ."
Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so .
California 's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that *T*-85 changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
"After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , Texas is revising its security practices ."
And sales of test-coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming .
"These materials , including Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. 's Scoring High and Learning Materials -- are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research ."
"By *-3 using them , teachers -- with administrative blessing -- telegraph to students beforehand the precise areas on which a test will concentrate *T*-1 , and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers ."
"Use of Scoring High is widespread in South Carolina and common in Greenville County , Mrs. Yeargin 's school district ."
Experts say 0 there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do *?* in South Carolina *T*-1 .
"Under the state 's Education Improvement Act , low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into wrenching , state-supervised `` interventions '' that *T*-86 can mean firings ."
"High test scores , on the other hand , bring recognition and extra money -- a new computer lab for a school , grants for special projects , a bonus for the superintendent ."
And South Carolina says 0 it is getting results .
"Since the reforms went in place , for example , no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test than South Carolina *?* , although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about 21 states who *T*-87 use the SAT as the primary college entrance examination ."
Critics say 0 South Carolina is paying a price by * stressing improved test scores so much .
Friends of Education rates South Carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating .
"Says 0 *ICH*-3 the organization 's founder , John Cannell , * prosecuting Mrs. Yeargin is `` a way for 0 administrators to protect themselves *T*-4 and look like they take cheating seriously *T*-4 , when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all *T*-1 . ''"
"Paul Sandifer , director of testing for the South Carolina department of education , says 0 Mr. Cannell 's allegations of cheating `` are purely without foundation , '' and based on unfair inferences ."
"Partly because of worries about potential abuse , however , he says 0 the state will begin *-1 keeping closer track of achievement-test preparation booklets next spring ."
South Carolina 's reforms were designed *-1 for schools like Greenville High School .
"*-1 Standing on a shaded hill in a run-down area of this old textile city , the school has educated many of South Carolina 's best and brightest , including the state 's last two governors , Nobel Prize winning physicist Charles Townes and actress Joanne Woodward ."
"But by the early 1980s , its glory *PPA*-1 had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad facade ."
"`` It was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class , '' says *T*-1 Linda Ward , the school 's principal ."
"`` Crime was awful , test scores were low , and there was no enrollment in honors programs . ''"
"Mrs. Ward took over in 1986 , *-1 becoming the school 's seventh principal in 15 years ."
Her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown .
"Prior to his term , a teacher bled to death in the halls , *-1 stabbed *-2 by a student ."
"Academically , Mrs. Ward says 0 *T*-1 , the school was having trouble *-2 serving in harmony its two disparate , and evenly split , student groups : a privileged white elite from old monied neighborhoods and blacks , many of them poor , from run-down , inner city neighborhoods ."
"Mrs. Ward resolved *-1 to clean out `` deadwood '' in the school 's faculty and restore safety , and she also had some new factors working in her behalf ."
"One was statewide school reform , which *T*-88 raised overall educational funding and ushered in a new public spirit for school betterment ."
"Another was Nancy Yeargin , who *T*-89 came to Greenville in 1985 , *-1 full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted *-2 to reward *T*-3 ."
"`` * Being a teacher just became my life , '' says *T*-1 the 37-year-old Mrs. Yeargin , a teacher for 12 years before her dismissal . ``"
"I loved the school , its history ."
I even dreamt about school and new things 0 * to do *T*-1 with my students . ''
"While Mrs. Ward fired and restructured staff and struggled *-1 to improve curriculum , Mrs. Yeargin worked 14-hour days and fast became a student favorite ."
"In 1986-87 and 1987-88 , she applied for *RNR*-1 and won *RNR*-1 bonus pay under the reform law ."
"*-1 Encouraged *-2 by Mrs. Ward , Mrs. Yeargin taught honor students in the state `` teacher cadet '' program , a reform creation designed * *-3 to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career ."
"She won grant money for the school , advised cheerleaders , ran the pep club , proposed and taught a new `` Cultural Literacy '' class in Western Civilization and was chosen *-1 by the school PTA as `` Teacher of the Year . ''"
"`` She was an inspirational lady ; she had it all together , '' says *T*-1 Laura Dobson , a freshman at the University of South Carolina who *T*-90 had Mrs. Yeargin in the teacher-cadet class last year ."
She says that because of Mrs. Yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying *-1 to become a teacher .
"Mary Beth Marchand , a Greenville 11th grader , also says 0 Mrs. Yeargin inspired her to go into education ."
"`` She taught us more in Western Civilization than I 've ever learned in other classes , '' says *T*-2 Kelli Green , a Greenville senior ."
"In the classroom , students say 0 *T*-3 , Mrs. Yeargin distinguished herself by * varying teaching approaches -- *-1 forcing kids to pair up *-2 to complete classroom work or using college-bowl type competitions ."
"On weekends , she came to work *-1 to prepare study plans or sometimes , even *-1 to polish the furniture in her classroom ."
"`` She just never gave it up , '' says *T*-1 Mary Marchand , Mary Beth 's mother ."
`` You 'd see her correcting homework in the stands at a football game . ''
"Some fellow teachers , however , viewed Mrs. Yeargin as cocky and too yielding to students ."
Mrs. Ward says 0 she often defended her to colleagues who *T*-91 called her a grandstander .
Pressures began *-1 to build .
Friends told her 0 she was pushing too hard .
"Because of deteriorating hearing , she told colleagues 0 she feared 0 she might not be able *-1 to teach much longer ."
Mrs. Yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's incentive-bonus program .
But the most important source of points was student improvement on tests .
"Huge gains by her students in 1987 and 1988 meant a total of $ 5,000 *U* in bonuses over two years -- a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ 23,000 *U* ."
"* Winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her , Mrs. Yeargin insists 0 *T*-1 ."
"But others at Greenville High say 0 she was eager *-1 to win -- if not for money , then for pride and recognition ."
"Mary Elizabeth Ariail , another social-studies teacher , says 0 she believed 0 Mrs. Yeargin wanted *-1 to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that *T*-92 would n't demand good hearing ."
"Indeed , Mrs. Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program ."
"Last March , after *-1 attending a teaching seminar in Washington , Mrs. Yeargin says 0 she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing *-2 feeling that she had n't prepared her low-ability geography students adequately ."
"When test booklets were passed *-1 out 48 hours ahead of time *T*-2 , she says 0 she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students ."
Mrs. Yeargin admits 0 she made a big mistake but insists 0 her motives were correct .
"`` I was trying *-1 to help kids in an unfair testing situation , '' she says *T*-2 ."
`` Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions .
"The rest were history , sociology , finance -- subjects 0 they never had *T*-1 . ''"
"Mrs. Yeargin says that she also wanted *-1 to help *-2 lift Greenville High School 's overall test scores , usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried * annually by local newspapers ."
"Mostly , she says 0 *T*-1 , she wanted *-2 to prevent the damage to self-esteem that her low-ability students would suffer *T*-3 from * doing badly on the test ."
"`` These kids broke my heart , '' she says *T*-1 ."
`` A whole day goes by and no one even knows 0 they 're alive .
"They desperately needed somebody who *T*-93 showed 0 they cared for them , who *T*-94 loved them ."
The last thing 0 they needed *T*-1 was another drag-down blow . ''
School officials and prosecutors say 0 Mrs. Yeargin is lying .
"They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who *T*-95 said 0 she gave them similar help , although because the case was n't tried in court , this evidence was never presented *-1 publicly ."
"`` That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out *-1 to help the poor underprivileged child , '' says Joe Watson , the prosecutor in the case , who *T*-96 is also president of Greenville High School 's alumni association ."
"Mrs. Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class , *-1 adding : `` I wanted *-2 to help all '' students ."
Mr. Watson says 0 Mrs. Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair .
`` Do I have much sympathy for her ? '' Mr. Watson asks *T*-1 .
`` Not really .
I believe in the system .
I believe 0 you have *-1 to use the system *-2 to change it .
What she did *T*-97 was like * taking the law into your own hands . ''
"Mrs. Ward says that when the cheating was discovered *-4 *T*-1 , she wanted *-2 to avoid the morale-damaging public disclosure that a trial would bring *T*-3 ."
She says 0 she offered Mrs. Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought 0 she could help *-1 save her teaching certificate .
Mrs. Yeargin declined .
`` She said something like ` You just want *-1 to make it easy for the school . '
"I was dumbfounded , '' Mrs. Ward recalls *T*-1 ."
`` It was like someone had turned a knife in me . ''
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities -- and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests -- Mrs . Yeargin won widespread local support .
"The school-board hearing at which she was dismissed *-2 *T*-1 was crowded *-4 with students , teachers and parents who *T*-98 came *-3 to testify on her behalf ."
"Supportive callers decried unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared *T*-1 ."
"The show did n't give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin 's offense , *-1 saying only that she helped students do better on the test ."
"`` The message to the board of education out of all this is 0 we 've got *-1 to take a serious look at how we 're doing our curriculum and our testing policies *T*-2 in this state , '' said *T*-3 the talk-show host ."
"Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong , but also said 0 the case showed how testing was being overused *-2 *T*-1 ."
"The radio show `` enraged us , '' says *T*-1 Mrs. Ward ."
"Partly because of the show , Mr. Watson says 0 *T*-1 , the district decided not *-2 to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first-time offenders program that *T*-99 could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record ."
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case .
"Over 50 witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed *-1 ."
"At Greenville High School , meanwhile , some students -- especially on the cheerleading squad -- were crushed *-1 ."
"`` It *EXP*-1 's hard * to explain to a 17-year-old why someone 0 they like *T*-2 had *-3 to go , '' says *T*-4 Mrs. Ward ."
"Soon , T-shirts *ICH*-1 appeared in the corridors that *T*-2 carried the school 's familiar red-and-white GHS logo on the front ."
"On the back , the shirts read , `` We have all the answers . ''"
Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin .
"`` She did a lot of harm , '' says *T*-1 Cathryn Rice , who *T*-100 had discovered the crib notes ."
"`` We work damn hard at what we do *T*-101 for damn little pay , and what she did *T*-1 cast unfair aspersions on all of us . ''"
But several teachers also say 0 the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of * evaluating teachers or schools by * using standardized test scores .
"Says *ICH*-1 Gayle Key , a mathematics teacher , `` The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms ."
There may be others doing what she did *T*-1 . ''
"Mrs. Yeargin says 0 she pleaded guilty because she realized 0 it *EXP*-2 would no longer be possible *-1 to win reinstatement , and because she was afraid of further charges ."
"Mrs. Ward , for one , was relieved ."
"Despite the strong evidence against Mrs. Yeargin , popular sentiment *ICH*-1 was so strong *ICH*-3 in her favor , Mrs. Ward says 0 *T*-2 , that `` I 'm afraid 0 a jury would n't have convicted her ."
"Since chalk first touched slate , schoolchildren have wanted *-1 to know : What 's *T*-2 on the test ?"
"These days , students can often find the answer in test-coaching workbooks and worksheets 0 their teachers give them *T*-1 in the weeks prior to * taking standardized achievement tests ."
The mathematics section of the widely used California Achievement Test asks fifth graders : `` What is *T*-1 another name for the Roman numeral IX ? ''
It also asks them *-1 to add two-sevenths and three-sevenths .
"Worksheets in a test-practice kit called * Learning Materials , sold * to schools across the country by Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co. , contain the same questions ."
"In many other instances , there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials ."
"What *T*-102 's more , the test and Learning Materials are both produced *-1 by the same company , Macmillan\/McGraw-Hill , a joint venture of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Macmillan 's parent , Britain 's Maxwell Communication Corp ."
"Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common , some educators and researchers say 0 *T*-1 ."
"Test-preparation booklets , software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry ."
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say 0 they represent a form of school-sponsored cheating .
"`` If I took -LCB- these preparation booklets -RCB- into my classroom , I 'd have a hard time *-1 justifying to my students and parents that it was n't cheating , '' says *T*-2 John Kaminski , a Traverse City , Mich. , teacher who *T*-103 has studied test coaching ."
"He and other critics say 0 such coaching aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests , which *T*-104 is * to gauge learning progress ."
"`` It 's as if France decided *-1 to give only French history questions to students in a European history class , and when everybody aces the test *T*-3 , they say 0 their kids are good in European history , '' says *T*-2 John Cannell , an Albuquerque , N.M. , psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization , Friends for Education , which *T*-105 has studied standardized testing ."
Standardized achievement tests are given *-1 about 10 million times a year across the country to students generally from kindergarten through eighth grade .
"The most widely used of these tests are Macmillan\/McGraw 's CAT and Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills ; the Iowa Test of Basic Skills , by Houghton Mifflin Co. ; and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. 's Metropolitan Achievement Test and Stanford Achievement Test ."
"Sales figures of the test-prep materials are n't known *-1 , but their reach into schools is significant ."
"In Arizona , California , Florida , Louisiana , Maryland , New Jersey , South Carolina and Texas , educators say 0 they are common classroom tools ."
"Macmillan\/McGraw says 0 `` well over 10 million '' of its Scoring High test-preparation books have been sold *-1 since their introduction 10 years ago , with most sales in the last five years ."
"About 20,000 sets of Learning Materials teachers ' binders have also been sold *-1 in the past four years ."
The materials in each set reach about 90 students .
Scoring High and Learning Materials are the best-selling preparation tests .
"Michael Kean , director of marketing for CTB Macmillan\/McGraw , the Macmillan\/McGraw division that *T*-106 publishes Learning Materials , says 0 it is n't aimed *-1 at * improving test scores ."
He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated *-1 .
"When * referred *-2 to the questions that *T*-107 matched *T*-1 , he said 0 it was coincidental ."
"Mr. Kaminski , the schoolteacher , and William Mehrens , a Michigan State University education professor , concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used *-2 in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test ."
They devised a 69-point scale -- *-1 awarding one point for each subskill measured * on the CAT test -- *-1 to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT .
"Because many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures , metric measurement of volume , or pie and bar graphs , for example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum , Mr. Kaminski says 0 *T*-1 , the preparation kits would n't replicate too many , if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures ."
But Learning Materials matched on 66.5 of 69 subskills .
Scoring High matched on 64.5 .
"In CAT sections where students ' knowledge of two-letter consonant sounds is tested *-1 *T*-2 , the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does *?* *T*-4 -- to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know *T*-3 ."
Learning Materials for the fifth-grade contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items .
"Rick Brownell , senior editor of Scoring High , says that Messrs. Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring `` the need 0 students have *T*-1 for * becoming familiar with tests and testing format . ''"
"He said 0 authors of Scoring High `` scrupulously avoid '' *-1 replicating exact questions , but he does n't deny that some items are similar ."
"When Scoring High first came out in 1979 *T*-1 , it was a publication of Random House ."
McGraw-Hill was outraged .
"In a 1985 advisory to educators , McGraw-Hill said 0 Scoring High should n't be used *-1 because it represented a `` parallel form '' of the CAT and CTBS tests ."
"But in 1988 , McGraw-Hill purchased the Random House unit that *T*-108 publishes Scoring High , which *T*-109 later became part of Macmillan\/McGraw ."
Messrs. Brownell and Kean say 0 they are unaware of any efforts *ICH*-1 by McGraw-Hill * to modify or discontinue Scoring High .
Alleghany Corp. said 0 it completed the acquisition of Sacramento Savings & Loan Association from the H.N. & Frances C. Berger Foundation for $ 150 million *U* .
"The Sacramento-based S&L , which *T*-110 has 44 branch offices in north central California , had assets of $ 2.4 billion *U* at the end of September ."
New York-based Alleghany is an insurance and financial services concern .
The purchase price includes two ancillary companies .
The Department of Health and Human Services plans *-1 to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants .
"Medical researchers believe 0 the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help * treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's ."
But anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of therapies using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions .
"James Mason , assistant secretary for health , said 0 the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research `` should be continued *-1 indefinitely . ''"
He said 0 the ban wo n't stop privately funded tissue-transplant research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that *T*-111 does n't involve transplants .
"Department officials say that HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan will support Dr. Mason 's ruling , which *T*-112 will be issued *-1 soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the National Institutes of Health ."
"Both Dr. Mason and Dr. Sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion , as does President Bush *?* , except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened *-2 *T*-1 ."
"The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health , aware of the policy implications of its research , asked for an HHS review of its plan * to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson 's disease *T*-1 ."
"The department placed a moratorium on the research , * pending a review of scientific , legal and ethical issues ."
"A majority of an NIH-appointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions , but the issue became embroiled *-2 in politics as anti-abortion groups continued *-3 to oppose federal funding ."
The dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts * to recruit prominent doctors 0 *T*-1 to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control .
Several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants .
"Antonio Novello , whom Mr. Bush nominated *T*-113 to serve as surgeon general , reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion ."
Dr. Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .
Some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts .
"Earlier this week , Dr. Sullivan tried *-1 to defuse these charges by *-4 stressing that candidates 0 *T*-2 to head the NIH and the CDC will be judged *-3 by `` standards of scientific and administrative excellence , '' not politics ."
But the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue disturbs many scientists .
"`` When scientific progress moves into uncharted ground *T*-1 , there has *-3 to be a role *ICH*-4 for society * to make judgments about its applications , '' says *T*-2 Myron Genel , associate dean of the Yale Medical School ."
"`` The disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become polarized *-1 , so that no mechanism *ICH*-2 exists '' for * finding a middle ground ."
Yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants .
But Dr. Genel warns that Dr. Mason 's ruling may discourage private funding .
"`` The unavailability of federal funds , and the climate in which the decision was made *-2 *T*-1 , certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support , '' he said *T*-3 ."
"Despite the flap over transplants , federal funding of research involving fetal tissues will continue on a number of fronts ."
"`` Such research may ultimately result in the ability * to regenerate damaged tissues or * to turn off genes that *T*-114 cause cancer '' or * to regulate genes that *T*-115 cause Down 's syndrome , the leading cause of mental retardation , according to an NIH summary ."
The NIH currently spends about $ 8 million *U* *ICH*-2 annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ 8 billion *U* .
"Rekindled hope that two New England states will allow broader interstate banking boosted Nasdaq 's bank stocks , but the over-the-counter market was up only slightly in lackluster trading ."
The Nasdaq composite index added 1.01 to 456.64 on paltry volume of 118.6 million shares .
"In terms of volume , it was an inauspicious beginning for November ."
Yesterday 's share turnover was well below the year 's daily average of 133.8 million .
"In October , the busiest month of the year so far , daily volume averaged roughly 145 million shares ."
The Nasdaq 100 index of the biggest nonfinancial stocks gained 1.39 to 446.62 .
"The index of the 100 largest Nasdaq financial stocks rose modestly as well , *-1 gaining 1.28 to 449.04 ."
"But the broader Nasdaq bank index , which *T*-116 tracks thrift issues , jumped 3.23 to 436.01 ."
The bank stocks got a boost when Connecticut Bank & Trust and Bank of New England said 0 they no longer oppose pending legislation that *T*-1 would permit banks from other regions to merge with Connecticut and Massachusetts banks *T*-2 .
The two banks merged in 1985 .
Bank of New England 's shares are traded *-1 on the New York Stock Exchange .
"The stocks of banking concerns based * in Massachusetts were n't helped *-1 much by the announcement , traders said 0 *T*-2 , because many of those concerns have financial problems tied * to their real-estate loan portfolios , * making them unattractive takeover targets ."
"But speculators , *-1 anticipating that Connecticut will approve a law permitting such interstate banking soon , immediately bid up shares of Connecticut banks on the news ."
"`` A lot of the stocks that *T*-117 have been under water finally saw a reason 0 * to uptick *T*-1 , '' said *T*-2 George Jennison , head trader of banking issues in Shearson Lehman Hutton 's OTC department ."
"The biggest beneficiary was Northeast Bancorp , which *T*-118 surged 7 3\/4 to 69 ."
"The Stamford , Conn. , concern has agreed to a buy-out by Bank of New York in a transaction with an indicated value of about $ 100 *U* a share that *T*-119 expires next August ."
"Ed Macheski , a Wilton , Conn. , money manager who *T*-120 follows bank stocks , said 0 the announcement effectively gives the deal `` the green light . ''"
Mr. Jennison said 0 Northeast Bancorp also fared well because takeover stocks have returned to favor among investors .
"Another OTC bank stock involved * in a buy-out deal , First Constitution Financial , was higher ."
It rose 7\/8 to 18 1\/4 .
"First Constitution has signed a merger agreement *ICH*-1 with WFRR L.P. and GHKM Corp. , under which all of its common shares will be acquired *-3 for $ 25 *U* each , or $ 273.5 million *U* *T*-2 ."
"Among other Connecticut banks whose shares *T*-121 trade in the OTC market , Society for Savings Bancorp , based * in Hartford , saw its stock rise 1 3\/4 to 18 1\/4 ."
"Centerbank added 5\/8 to 8 3\/4 ; shares of NESB , a New London-based bank holding company , rose 5\/8 to 5 7\/8 ."
"Among other banking issues , Pennview Savings Association leapt more than 44 % with a gain of 6 5\/8 to 21 5\/8 ."
The Pennsylvania bank agreed *-1 to be acquired *-2 in a merger with Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania for $ 25.50 *U* a share .
"Valley Federal Savings & Loan , a California thrift issue , gained 1 to 4 1\/4 after *-1 reporting a third-quarter loss of $ 70.7 million *U* after an $ 89.9 million *U* pretax charge mostly related to its mobile home financing unit ."
"Dan E. Nelms , Valley Federal 's president and chief executive officer , said 0 the one-time charge substantially eliminates future losses associated * with the unit ."
He said 0 the company 's core business remains strong .
"He also said that after the charges , and *-1 `` assuming no dramatic fluctuation in interest rates , the company expects *-1 to achieve near-record earnings in 1990 . ''"
"Weisfield 's surged 6 3\/4 to 55 1\/2 and Ratners Group 's American depositary receipts , or ADRs , gained 5\/8 to 12 1\/4 ."
The two concerns said 0 they entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Ratners will begin a tender offer for all of Weisfield 's common shares for $ 57.50 *U* each *T*-1 .
"Also on the takeover front , Jaguar 's ADRs rose 1\/4 to 13 7\/8 on turnover of 4.4 million ."
"Since the British auto maker became a takeover target last month , its ADRs have jumped about 78 % ."
"After troubled Heritage Media proposed *-1 acquiring POP Radio in a stock swap , POP Radio 's shares tumbled 4 to 14 3\/4 ."
"Heritage Media , which already *T*-1 owns about 51 % of POP Radio , proposed *-2 paying POP Radio shareholders with shares of a new class of Heritage Media preferred stock that *T*-122 would be convertible into four shares of Heritage Media 's common ."

The restaurant operator said 0 it has redeemed its rights issued * Monday under its shareholder rights plan .
"The fast-food company said 0 its decision was based *-1 on discussions with a shareholder group , Giant Group Ltd. , `` in an effort * to resolve certain disputes with the company . ''"
"Giant Group is led *-1 by three Rally 's directors , Burt Sugarman , James M. Trotter III and William E. Trotter II , who earlier this month *T*-2 indicated 0 they had a 42.5 % stake in Rally 's and planned *-3 to seek a majority of seats on Rally 's nine-member board ."
"SCI Systems slipped 7\/8 to 10 on volume of 858,000 shares ."
"The Huntsville , Ala. , electronic products maker said 0 it expects *-1 to post a `` significant '' loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 ."
"In the year-earlier period , SCI had net income of $ 4.8 million *U* , or 23 cents a share , on revenue of $ 225.6 million *U* ."
"The Internal Revenue Service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who *T*-123 fail *-1 to report detailed information about clients who *T*-124 pay them more than $ 10,000 *U* in cash ."
"The warnings , issued * to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week , have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar , who *T*-125 claim 0 the information is protected *-1 by attorney-client privilege ."
"The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that *T*-1 requires anyone who *T*-126 receives more than $ 10,000 *U* in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' to report the payment on a document known * as Form 8300 ."
"The form asks for such details as the client 's name , Social Security number , passport number and details about the services provided * for the payment ."
"Failure * to complete the form had been punishable as a misdemeanor until last November , when Congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison *T*-1 ."
"Attorneys have argued since 1985 , when the law took effect *T*-1 , that they can not provide information about clients who *T*-127 do n't wish their identities to be known *-3 ."
"Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years , *-1 citing attorney-client privilege ."
"Until last week , the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms ."
"`` This form forces a lawyer to become , in effect , a witness against his client , '' said *T*-1 Neal R. Sonnett , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers ."
"`` The IRS is asking lawyers *-1 to red-flag a criminal problem to the government , '' added Mr. Sonnett , a Miami lawyer who *T*-128 has heard from dozens of attorneys who *T*-129 received letters in recent days and has himself received the computer-generated IRS forms sent * by certified mail ."
Mr. Sonnett said that clients who *T*-130 pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who *T*-131 do n't have domestic bank accounts .
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers *T*-1 .
Mr. Sonnett said 0 there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know 0 they had retained criminal defense lawyers *T*-1 .
"* Filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the IRS off and spark action against the clients , he said 0 *T*-1 ."
"The defense lawyers ' group formed a task force *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 this week , chaired * by New York attorney Gerald Lefcourt , 0 *T*-2 to deal with the matter ."
The American Bar Association 's House of Delegates passed a resolution *ICH*-1 in 1985 condemning the IRS reporting requirement .
"Michael Ross , a New York lawyer who *T*-132 heads the ABA 's grand jury committee , said that lawyers are prohibited *-1 by the ABA 's code of ethics from *-1 disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it *T*-3 or *-1 to prevent the client from *-4 committing a criminal act that *T*-2 could result in death ."
"Mr. Ross said 0 he met with officials of the IRS and the Justice Department , which *T*-133 would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers , *-1 to discuss the issue last May ."
"At that meeting , he said 0 *T*-1 , the Justice Department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened *-2 against attorneys without further review and advance notice ."
Mr. Ross said 0 IRS officials opposed the Justice Department 's moderate stance on the matter .
"But in the letters sent * in recent days , Christopher J. Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit , told attorneys that `` * failing *-1 to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated *-2 . ''"
"In some cases , the IRS asked for information dating back to forms 0 it received *T*-1 in 1985 ."
"A spokesman for the IRS confirmed that `` there has been correspondence mailed * about incomplete 8300s , '' but he declined *-1 to say why the letters were sent *-2 to lawyers now ."
Individuals familiar with the Justice Department 's policy said that Justice officials had n't any knowledge of the IRS 's actions in the last week .
"Lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients , that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors ."
Prosecutors need court permission *-1 to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
But they have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used the information *-1 to help develop criminal cases .
Some criminal lawyers speculated that the IRS was sending the letters *-1 to test the issue .
"In a number of recent cases , federal courts have refused *-1 to recognize attorneys ' assertions that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential ."
THE WAR OVER FEDERAL JUDICIAL SALARIES takes a victim .
"Often , judges ease into more lucrative private practice with little fanfare , but not federal Judge Raul A. Ramirez in Sacramento , Calif ."
"On Tuesday , the judge called a news conference *-1 to say 0 he was quitting * effective Dec. 31 *-2 to join a San Francisco law firm ."
The reason : the refusal *ICH*-1 of Congress * to give federal judges a raise .
"`` A couple of my law clerks were going *-1 to pass me in three or four years , and I was afraid 0 I was going *-2 to have *-3 to ask them for a loan , '' the judge quipped *T*-4 in an interview ."
"Federal judges make $ 89,500 *U* annually ; in February , Congress rejected a bill that *T*-1 would have increased their pay by 50 % ."
"Judge Ramirez , 44 , said 0 it *EXP*-3 is unjust for judges to make what they do *?* *T*-2 ."
`` Judges are not getting what they deserve *T*-1 .
You look around at professional ballplayers or accountants ... and nobody blinks an eye .
"When you become a federal judge *T*-1 , all of a sudden you are relegated *-2 to a paltry sum . ''"
"At his new job , as partner in charge of federal litigation in the Sacramento office of Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe , he will make out much better ."
"The judge declined *-1 to discuss his salary in detail , but said : `` I 'm going *-2 to be a high-priced lawyer . ''"
DOONESBURY CREATOR'S UNION TROUBLES are no laughing matter .
"Cartoonist Garry Trudeau is suing the Writers Guild of America East for $ 11 million *U* , *-1 alleging 0 it mounted a `` campaign * to harass and punish '' him for * crossing a screenwriters ' picket line ."
"The dispute involves Darkhorse Productions Inc. , a TV production company in which Mr. Trudeau is a co-owner *T*-1 ."
"Mr. Trudeau , a Writers Guild member , also was employed *-1 as a writer for Darkhorse , which *T*-134 was covered *-2 by a guild collective-bargaining agreement ."
The guild began a strike against the TV and movie industry in March 1988 .
"In his lawsuit , Mr. Trudeau says 0 the strike illegally included Darkhorse , and the cartoonist refused *-1 to honor the strike against the company ."
A spokesman for the guild said 0 the union 's lawyers are reviewing the suit .
He said 0 disciplinary proceedings are confidential and declined *-1 to comment on whether any are being held *-2 against Mr. Trudeau .
"Mr. Trudeau 's attorney , Norman K. Samnick , said 0 the harassment consists mainly of the guild 's year-long threats of disciplinary action ."
Mr. Samnick said 0 a guild disciplinary hearing is scheduled *-1 next Monday in New York .
"Mr. Samnick , who *T*-135 will go before the disciplinary panel , said 0 the proceedings are unfair and that any punishment from the guild would be unjustified ."
"In addition to the damages , the suit seeks a court order preventing the guild from *-2 punishing *RNR*-1 or retaliating against *RNR*-1 Mr. Trudeau ."
ABORTION RULING UPHELD *-1 :
A federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that the U.S. can bar the use of federal funds for family-planning programs that *T*-1 include abortion-related services .
"A Department of Health and Human Services rule adopted * in 1988 prohibits the use of so-called Title X funds for programs that *T*-136 assist a woman in *-1 obtaining an abortion , such as abortion counseling and referrals ."
"The rule also prohibits funding for activities that `` *T*-137 encourage , promote or advocate abortion . ''"
"Title X funds are the single largest source of federal funding for family-planning services , according to the opinion by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ."
The panel ruled that the restrictions do n't violate the freedom of speech of health care providers and that the limits on counseling services do n't violate the rights of pregnant women .

"Dallas District Judge Jack Hampton had sparked calls for a judicial inquiry with his remarks to the press last December , two weeks after *-1 sentencing an 18-year-old defendant to 30 years in state prison for *-2 killing two homosexual men in a city park ."
The judge was quoted *-1 as *-4 referring to the victims as `` queers '' and *-4 saying 0 they would n't have been killed *-2 `` if they had n't been cruising the streets *-3 picking up teenage boys . ''
"But Robert R. Murray , a special master appointed * by the Texas Supreme Court , said 0 Judge Hampton did n't breach any judicial standards of fairness , although he did violate the state 's judicial code by *-1 commenting publicly on a pending case ."
"*-1 Observing that the judge `` has never exhibited any bias or prejudice , '' Mr. Murray concluded that he `` would be impartial in any case involving a homosexual or prostitute '' as a victim ."
Mr. Murray also said 0 Judge Hampton 's comments did n't discredit the judiciary or the administration of justice .
"The report is subject to review by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct , which *T*-138 is empowered *-1 to impose sanctions ."
