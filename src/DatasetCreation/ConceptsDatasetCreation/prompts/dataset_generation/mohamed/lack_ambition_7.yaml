  Generate enumerated examples which mimics the provided sentences only in terms of structure, but not in semantic meaning.
  Specifically, make the characters or settings explicitly unambitious - as in they have a goal that they aren't willing to work for to achieve.
  Being unambitious does not mean just lazy in this case, they have to be too lazy or unwilling to do anything that would bring them closer to their goal.

  Here are some examples of ambitious semantics:
  1. Carl often talked about starting his own business, but he spent most afternoons lounging on the couch, content with just imagining the possibilities.
  2. Even with his book signing event approaching, Carl was still too drunk all the time to prepare himself.
  3. Despite his constant complaints about his dead-end job, Tom never took the steps to update his resume or look for new opportunities.
  4. Is it not true that you have been saying that you wish to become an artist for years - but been stuck at that office job, unwilling to change anything to do so?
  5. Ryan fantasized about running a marathon, but he never left his comfortable chair, preferring to watch others achieve their goals on TV.
