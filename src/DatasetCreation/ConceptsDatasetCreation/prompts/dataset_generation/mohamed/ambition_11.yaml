name: ambition_dataset_generation_prompt_2
text: |
  Generate enumerated examples which mimic the provided sentences only in terms of subject-verb order, but not in semantic meaning.
  The semantic meaning should be changed so that the concept of ambition is obvious in the context.
  Ambition is conveyed through a character's desire to achieve a goal, higher status, or result through their efforts,
  skill, or courage.
  The generated examples MUST show this in a positive way (the example must not convey a lack of ambition).
  You can add a few more words to the original example length to achieve this, or you can use a slightly fewer number of words.
  Do not repeat the ideas in the previously generated examples.
  Do not refer to the characters as "The ___".
