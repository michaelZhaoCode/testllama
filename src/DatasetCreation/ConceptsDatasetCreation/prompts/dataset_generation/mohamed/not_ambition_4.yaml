name: not_ambition_dataset_generation_prompt_3
text: |
  Generate {num_examples} examples unrelated to the concept of ambition.
  These examples can consist of one or more sentences as long as it does not bring the concept to mind, even in a negative way, where there is an absence of it.
  Make the examples long.
  Vary the point of view of each example to include first, second, and third person examples.
  Vary the tense used in each example, using a variety of present, past, and future tenses in your examples.
  Your subjects must be human.
  Do not focus on the setting, your examples must be character-focused.
  Give more insight to the character without the use of settings, providing enough context with the character's actions such that one can infer the personality of the character.
  Each example should be numbered.
  Each example should only contain the example itself and the enumeration, with no additional annotation.
