name: ambition_dataset_generation_prompt_2
text: |
  Generate enumerated examples which mimics the provided sentences only in terms of subject-verb order, but not in semantic meaning.
  The semantic meaning should be changed so that the concept of lack of ambition is obvious in the context.
  Lack of ambition is conveyed through a character's lack of desire to achieve a goal, higher status,
  or result through their efforts, skill, or courage.
  The generated examples MUST show ambition in a negative way (the example must convey a lack of ambition).
  You can add a few more words to the original example length to achieve this, or you can use a slightly fewer number of words.
  Keep in mind the examples generated in the previous messages when generating new examples.
  Don't repeat the ideas in the generated examples.
