name: ambition_dataset_generation_prompt_2
text: |
  Generate enumerated examples from which the concept of the lack of ambition is inferred -
  specifically where the character has little or no ambition.
  The structure of the generated examples should match the provided examples,
  but the meaning of the generated examples should be different such that a lack of ambition can be found.
  A reminder that a lack of ambition is conveyed through a character's lack of desire to achieve a goal, level,
  or result through their efforts, skill, or courage - this should be observable in your generated examples.
  Vary the scale and theme of the goals in all of your examples,
  keeping in mind examples generated in previous messages.
