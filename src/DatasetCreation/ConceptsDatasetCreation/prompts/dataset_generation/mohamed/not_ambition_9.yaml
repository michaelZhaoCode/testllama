text: |
  Generate enumerated examples which mimics the provided sentences only in terms of subject-verb order, but not in semantic meaning.
  The semantic meaning should be changed so that the context is irrelevant to ambition whatsoever.
  Ambition is conveyed through a character's desire to achieve a goal, higher status,
  or result through their efforts, skill, or courage.
  The context must still be focused on human subjects rather than on the setting or surrounding environment.
  You can add a few more words to the original example length to achieve this, or you can use a slightly fewer number of words.
  Keep in mind the examples generated in the previous messages when generating new examples.
  Don't repeat the ideas in the generated examples.
