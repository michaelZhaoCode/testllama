text: |
  Generate enumerated examples which mimics the provided sentences only in terms of subject-verb order, but not in semantic meaning.
  The semantic meaning should be changed so that the context is irrelevant to ambition whatsoever.
  Ambition is conveyed through a character's desire to achieve a goal, higher status,
  or result through their efforts, skill, or courage.
  The context must still be focused on human subjects rather than on the setting or surrounding environment.
  You can add a few more words to the original example length to achieve this, or you can use a slightly fewer number of words.
  Keep in mind the examples generated in the previous messages when generating new examples.
  Don't repeat the ideas in the generated examples.
  Do not refer to the characters as "The ___".

continuation_text: |
  This time, the examples should be in a {context} context, make sure that the actions the characters take do not have any observable ambition or lack thereof, even in this setting.
  Generate exactly {num_examples} examples based on the given enumerated examples. Output only the example and its enumeration:
