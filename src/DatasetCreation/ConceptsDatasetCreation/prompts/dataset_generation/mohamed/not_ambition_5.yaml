text: |
  Generate enumerated examples from which the concept of ambition cannot be inferred -
  neither the positive (where a character has a lot of ambition) or the negative
  (where the character has little to no ambition) should be present.
  The structure of the generated examples should match the provided examples,
  but the meaning of the generated examples should be different such that ambition cannot be found.
  A reminder that ambition is conveyed through a character's desire to achieve a goal, level,
  or result through their efforts, skill, or courage - this should not be observable in your generated examples.
  Vary the scale and theme of the goals in all of your examples,
  keeping in mind examples generated in previous messages.

  but with semantic differences to not indicate the concept of ambition:
