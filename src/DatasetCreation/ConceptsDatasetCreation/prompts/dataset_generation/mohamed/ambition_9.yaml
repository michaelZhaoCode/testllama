text: |
  Generate enumerated examples which mimics the provided sentences only in terms of subject-verb order, but not in semantic meaning.
  The semantic meaning should be changed so that the concept of ambition is obvious in the context.
  Ambition is conveyed through a character's desire to achieve a goal, higher status, or result through their efforts,
  skill, or courage.
  The generated examples MUST show this in a positive way (the example must not convey a lack of ambition).
  You can add a few more words to the original example length to achieve this, or you can use a slightly fewer number of words.
  Vary the scale and theme of the goals in all of your examples - not all examples should be related to corporate topics.
  Keep in mind the examples generated in the previous messages when generating new examples.
  Don't repeat the ideas in the generated examples.
