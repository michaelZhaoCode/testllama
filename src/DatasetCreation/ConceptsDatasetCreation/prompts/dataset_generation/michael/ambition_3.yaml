text: |
  Generate {num_examples} examples from which the concept of ambition is inferred.
  Contain examples that are found both in everyday life and also unique examples.
  The concept can be conveyed in both positive (where one has some or strong ambition) and negative (where one has little to no ambition).
  For each example, provide a bit more context.
  Vary the scale of the goal, from simpler and every-day short term goals, to larger goals.
  Vary the point of view of each example to include first, second, and third person examples.
  For most of the examples, do not explicitly mention the word ambition, but mention it for some of them.
  Each example should be numbered.
