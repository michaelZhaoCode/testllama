text: |
  Generate enumerated examples from which the concept ambition cannot be inferred - neither the positive (where a character
  has a lot of ambition) or the negative (where the character has little to no ambition) should be present.
  The structure should match the provided example sentence, but the meaning of the sentence should be different such that
  ambition can be found. A reminder that ambition is conveyed through a character's desire to achieve a
  goal, level, or result through their efforts, skill, or courage - this should not be observable in your generated examples.

  Vary the scale and theme of all of your examples, keeping in mind examples generated in previous user prompts.
