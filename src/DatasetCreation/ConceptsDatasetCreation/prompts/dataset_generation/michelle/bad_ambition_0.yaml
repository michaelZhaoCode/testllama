text: |
  Generate enumerated examples from which the concept of the lack of ambition is inferred - specifically where
  the character has little or no ambition. The structure should match the provided example sentence,
  but the meaning of the sentence should be different such that ambition can be found. A reminder that a lack of ambition
  is conveyed through a character's lack of desire to achieve a goal, level, or result through their efforts, skill, or
  courage - this should be observable in your generated examples.

  Vary the scale and theme of the goals in all of your examples, keeping in mind examples generated in previous user prompts.
